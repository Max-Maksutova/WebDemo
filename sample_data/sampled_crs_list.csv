Reports,R46521,2020-09-08 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Political Campaign Contributions and Congress: A Legal Primer,2025-04-18T19:49:32Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46521,113,L. Paige Whitaker,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46521/R46521.9.pdf,"To help curb corruption in the political process and safeguard First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association, Congress has enacted laws that regulate political campaign contributions. These laws include political patronage and campaign finance laws.
Federal political patronage laws serve to protect federal employees—including congressional staff—from being required to make campaign contributions as a condition of employment. These criminal laws include a prohibition on Members of Congress, congressional candidates, and congressional staff from knowingly soliciting federal office campaign contributions from another such officer, employee, or person receiving compensation for services from money derived from the U.S. Treasury. Similarly, federal law prohibits congressional staff from making contributions to a Member of Congress who is the staffer’s employer. Members of Congress and congressional staff are also prohibited from discharging, demoting, or promoting, or threatening to do so, another congressional employee for making or failing to make a campaign contribution to candidates for federal, state, and local office. Relating to federal workspace, federal law prohibits any person from soliciting or receiving a donation of money or other thing of value in connection with a federal, state, or local election from anyone located in federal workspace. In support of the policy underlying such laws, the Supreme Court has determined that, with the exception of policymaking and confidential government positions, personnel decisions made solely on the basis of political party association violate employee First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. 
Federal campaign finance laws regulate campaign contributions made to congressional candidates by establishing limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) defines a contribution to include money or anything of value that is made for the purpose of influencing any federal election. A contribution can be distinguished from an expenditure in that a contribution involves giving money to an entity, such as a candidate’s campaign committee, while an expenditure involves spending money directly for advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate. For knowing and willful violations of FECA, criminal penalties may be imposed.
Campaign Contribution Limits
Contribution limits refer to how much a donor can contribute as well as how they can contribute. Contribution limits include specific limits on how much money individuals may contribute to a congressional candidate, which are known as base limits. In the current 2019-2020 federal election cycle, an individual can contribute up to $2,800, per election, to a candidate. These limits are periodically adjusted for inflation in odd-numbered years. FECA also provides for related restrictions, including the ban on contributions made through a conduit; the ban on converting campaign contributions for personal use; and the treatment of communications a donor makes in coordination with a candidate or party as contributions. The Supreme Court has generally upheld the constitutionality of these restrictions to protect against quid pro quo corruption and its appearance. Although the Court has generally upheld reasonable base limits, the Court has struck down FECA’s aggregate limits, which capped the total amount of money a donor could contribute to all candidates, parties, and political committees; limits on contributions to candidates whose opponents self-finance; and limits on contributions by minors. In addition, based on Supreme Court precedent, an appellate court ruling provided the legal underpinning for the establishment of super political action committees (super PACs), ruling that limits on contributions to groups that make only independent expenditures are unconstitutional.
Campaign Contribution Source Restrictions
FECA contains several bans, referred to as source restrictions, on who may make campaign contributions. Source restrictions include the ban on corporate and labor union campaign contributions directly from their treasury funds—although the Supreme Court has held that limits on corporate and labor union independent spending are unconstitutional, the Court has upheld limits on contributions. Source restrictions also include the ban on federal contractor contributions—known as the “pay-to-play” prohibition—and the ban on foreign national contributions.
Campaign Contribution Disclosure Requirements
Under FECA, candidate campaign committees must register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and comply with disclosure requirements. Such requirements include filing periodic reports that include the total amount of all contributions received, and the identity, address, occupation, and employer of any person who contributes more than $200 during a calendar year. The Supreme Court has generally upheld the constitutionality of disclosure requirements as substantially related to the governmental interest of safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process by promoting transparency and accountability.","Campaign Finance, Civil Rights & Liberties",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R46521

Reports,R43456,2014-03-31 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Risk-Based Approaches to Airline Passenger Screening,2025-04-18T18:31:12Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R43456,109,Bart Elias,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R43456/R43456.4.pdf,"Until recently, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) had applied relatively uniform methods to screen airline passengers, focusing primarily on advances in screening technology to improve security and efficiency. TSA has recently shifted away from this approach, which assumes a uniform level of risk among all airline travelers, to one that focuses more intently on passengers thought to pose elevated security risks. Risk-based passenger screening includes a number of initiatives that fit within a broader framework addressing security risks, but specifically emphasizes the detection and management of potential threats posed by passengers.
Various risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening have been used since the early 1970s, including the application of rudimentary behavioral profiles, security questions, and analysis of ticket-purchase data to look for indicators of heightened risk. Additionally, “no-fly” lists were developed to prevent known or suspected terrorists from boarding aircraft, but prior to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, these lists were not robust and proved ineffective. 
Following the 9/11 attacks, TSA’s initial risk-based efforts focused on integrating checks of passenger name records against the “no fly” list of individuals to be denied boarding and the “selectee” list of individuals of elevated risk requiring more thorough secondary screening. These efforts culminated in the deployment of Secure Flight, which screens each passenger’s full name and date of birth against terrorist watchlists. Additionally, international passengers are screened by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which uses the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) and the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) to conduct risk assessments.
At airports, TSA employs behavioral detection and analysis under the Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program in an effort to identify suspicious passengers. Another risk-based security program is Pre-Check, a trusted traveler program designed to expedite processing of low-risk passengers. In addition to the Pre-Check participants, TSA is routing certain other passengers through expedited lanes using behavior detection officers and canine teams to screen for suspicious behavior and explosives under an initiative called managed inclusion.
Implementation of risk-based passenger screening raises numerous issues of congressional interest. These include the efficacy of the SPOT program; how the various elements and programs complement each other and integrate with TSA’s other layers of security; the risk-based approach’s ability to adapt and evolve over time; the ability to measure its effectiveness; the potential impacts of false positives on the traveling public; and implications for safeguarding data and maintaining privacy.","Aviation, Transportation Security",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R43456
Reports,R46234,2023-12-18 05:00:00+00:00,Active,School Meals and Other Child Nutrition Programs: Background and Funding,2025-04-18T22:17:47Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46234,125,Kara Clifford Billings,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46234/R46234.12.pdf,"The federal government has a long history of investing in programs for feeding children, starting with federal aid for school lunch programs in the 1930s. Today, federal child nutrition programs support food served to children in schools and a variety of other settings. Administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the child nutrition programs include the
National School Lunch Program (NSLP), 
School Breakfast Program (SBP), 
Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), 
Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), 
Seamless Summer Option (SSO), 
Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) Program,
Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), and 
Special Milk Program (SMP). 
The child nutrition programs vary in terms of size and target population. The largest programs are NSLP and SBP (the school meals programs), which subsidize meals for more than 30 million children in approximately 90,000 elementary and secondary schools in a typical school year. CACFP supports food served to children in child care, day care, and afterschool settings; SFSP and SSO provide funding for summer meals and snacks; Summer EBT provides grocery benefits for households with school-age children over the summer; FFVP sponsors fruit and vegetable snacks in elementary schools; and SMP subsidizes milk in schools and institutions that do not participate in other child nutrition programs. In general, the largest subsidies are provided for free or reduced-price meals and snacks served to children from low-income households. Other child nutrition activities include afterschool meal and snack programs, farm to school initiatives, and school meal equipment grants. 
Selected Child Nutrition Programs: Estimated Participants and Meal Sites, FY2022
/
Source: CRS, based on USDA-FNS, “June 2023 Keydata Report,” September 8, 2023.
Notes: Numbers are rounded. FY2022 data are preliminary.
Federal spending on child nutrition programs and activities totaled roughly $38 billion in FY2022, the majority of which was mandatory spending. Most child nutrition programs are considered appropriated entitlements, meaning that their authorizing statutes establish a legal obligation to make payments, but that obligation is fulfilled through funding that is provided in annual appropriations acts. Most of the funding is provided in the form of per-meal cash reimbursements that states distribute to schools and institutions. A smaller amount of federal funding is provided in the form of federally purchased foods and cash for states’ administrative expenses.
The child nutrition programs are primarily governed by two statutes: the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 as amended. These laws were most recently reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296), which made several changes to the child nutrition programs. For example, the act created the Community Eligibility Provision, an option for eligible schools to provide free meals to all students. It also required USDA to update nutrition standards in the school meals programs and CACFP within a certain timeframe. While certain provisions of the HHFKA expired at the end of FY2015, program operations have continued with annual appropriations. More recently, temporary changes to the child nutrition programs were made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (generally not discussed in this report; see CRS Report R46681, USDA Nutrition Assistance Programs: Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic).","Food & Nutrition Assistance, Nutrition Programs & Policies, School Nutrition & Health",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R46234
Reports,R46867,2021-08-04 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7 Consultation and Infrastructure Projects,2025-04-18T20:31:44Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46867,102,"Erin H. Ward, Pervaze A. Sheikh",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46867/R46867.2.pdf,"Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.) requires federal agencies (often referred to as action agencies) to ensure that actions they undertake, authorize, or fund are not likely to jeopardize threatened or endangered species (i.e., listed species) or adversely modify designated critical habitat of listed species. To satisfy this mandate, Section 7 generally requires action agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (together, the Services) when their proposed actions may affect listed species or critical habitat. Actions subject to Section 7 may include infrastructure projects that are undertaken by action agencies or by nonfederal entities with federal authorization or funding. Section 7 has frequently been of interest to Congress, in part, because it can affect infrastructure projects.
Section 7 consultation is a multistep process (see Figure) generally used to evaluate the effects of agency actions on listed species and critical habitat and to consider alternatives to minimize those effects, as needed. The action agency must assess whether listed species or critical habitat may be present in the area affected by the action (known as the action area) and, if present, whether the action may affect any such resources. The action agency or relevant nonfederal entity may opt to enter into informal consultation with the Services. The process may conclude if the Services and action agency agree that listed species or critical habitat are not in the action area or that the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat. If the action may adversely affect listed species or critical habitat, the action agency generally must enter into formal consultation with the relevant Services to assess the action. Formal consultation concludes with the Services issuing an opinion on the effects of the action referred to as a biological opinion (BiOp).
A BiOp contains analyses of the likely effects of the action on listed species and critical habitat and a statement of a Service’s opinion as to whether the action is likely to jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat. The Service may issue a no jeopardy or jeopardy BiOp. For jeopardy BiOps, the ESA requires the Service to suggest any reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to the proposed action that would avoid causing jeopardy or adverse modification. A BiOp generally also includes an incidental take statement authorizing certain actions that otherwise would be prohibited by Section 9 of the ESA.
The Section 7 consultation process may be expedited or waived under certain circumstances, some of which may apply to infrastructure projects. Action agencies may pursue programmatic consultations for repeated types of projects to streamline future individual action consultations. In certain emergency situations, regulations allow federal agencies to undertake an alternative consultation process in an expedited time frame. For actions that receive a jeopardy BiOp for which there are no RPAs, the action agency can seek an exemption from the ESA requirements. The President may waive the Section 7 requirements for certain types of projects in declared natural disaster areas. Congress may also include a waiver of Section 7 requirements directly in legislation for specific projects or types of projects.
Many actions, including infrastructure projects, may comply with Section 7 without requiring informal or formal consultation if the action agency or nonfederal entity finds that either no listed species or critical habitat are present in the action area or that such species or critical habitat will not be affected by the action. Section 7 consultation, however, may delay an infrastructure project or induce project modifications (either required or voluntary) to reduce its effect on listed species. In addition, litigation over the final BiOp may delay the project.","Wildlife & Ecosystems, Natural Resources Policy, Environmental Review & Policy",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R46867

Hogue, Rebecca R. Skinner",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R48425/R48425.4.pdf,"The U.S. Department of Education (ED) was established by the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA, P.L. 96-88) on October 17, 1979, to “ensure that education issues receive proper treatment at the Federal level” and to “enable the Federal Government to coordinate its education activities more effectively.” ED operations began in May 1980. Prior to the establishment of ED as a Cabinet-level agency in 1979, an Office of Education was housed at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). Although ED has had ongoing support from Congress through appropriations and regular review of, and amendments to, the authorizing statutes for its components, the department’s first 45 years have also seen efforts to reorganize ED and, in some cases, to abolish or diminish the agency. Similarly, successive Administrations have sometimes sought to alter ED through administrative actions and legislative initiatives, including, for example, by changing the office structure at the agency.
The DEOA establishes officers, positions, and offices at ED. For example, these statutory provisions establish the Secretary of Education (hereinafter referred to as the Secretary), Deputy Secretary of Education, and several Assistant Secretary positions (e.g., Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education). All of these officers are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. In addition, the DEOA establishes other positions at ED, such as a director of the Office of Indian Education and a director of the Office of Educational Technology. The DEOA also establishes specified offices including, for example, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE), and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS).
Section 413(a) of the DEOA authorizes the Secretary to reallocate functions among ED’s officers and “establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue” offices within ED. Exceptions to the reorganization authority granted to the Secretary by Section 413(a) include any office transferred to ED and established by statute or any function of such an office vested in it by statute. Additionally, the Secretary may not use the authority provided under Section 413(a) to abolish any of the offices established by the DEOA or alter the “delegation of functions to any specific organizational entity required by” the DEOA except as permitted by Section 413(b). Section 413(b) provides the Secretary with explicit authority to “consolidate, alter, or discontinue ... or reallocate any functions vested by statute” in the listed statutory entities. For example, these entities include the Office of Indian Education; the Office of English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement for Limited English Proficient Students; and the Office of Non-Public Education. Administrative reorganization under Section 413(a) may also be affected by transfer and reprogramming provisions included in annual appropriations acts.","Federal Government Organization, Elementary & Secondary Education, Postsecondary Education",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R48425
Reports,R46838,2021-07-13 04:00:00+00:00,Archived,Child Welfare in the President’s FY2022 Budget Request: In Brief,2025-04-18T20:42:48Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46838,103,Emilie Stoltzfus,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46838/R46838.1.pdf,"The President’s FY2022 budget request includes about $11.8 billion in funding for child welfare purposes. In FY2021, $12.6 billion was provided under the same child welfare authorities. However, as much as $2.0 billion of the FY2021 funding is temporary or additional funding provided generally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or to assist with implementation of the Family First Prevention Services Act (Title VII, Division E, P.L. 115-123). At the federal level, child welfare funding is primarily administered by the Children’s Bureau, an agency within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Several competitive grant programs included in the Victims of Child Abuse Act are administered by the Office of Justice Programs at the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The FY2022 budget requests $9.7 billion to support provision of foster care, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (Title IV-E program). The FY2022 request for Title IV-E support is roughly $135 million less than the sum expected to be necessary for these activities in FY2021. The decline is based on an expected end (during FY2022) of the pandemic-related increase in federal cost sharing for Title IV-E assistance payments. During FY2022, the number of Title IV-E eligible children receiving assistance on an average monthly basis is expected to total about 720,000 (including 522,000 receiving adoption assistance, 152,000 receiving foster care maintenance, and 46,000 receiving guardianship assistance). This is up from the estimated 700,000 children receiving these types of assistance in FY2021. Most of the expected growth is attributed to expected increases in the number of children receiving adoption assistance.
FY2022 will be the third year that states and tribes may opt to use the Title IV-E program to offer selected, evidence-based prevention services. As of late June 2021, there were 13 jurisdictions (11 states, the District of Columbia, one tribe) with an approved Title IV-E prevention services plan and 15 additional jurisdictions (13 states, two tribes) had submitted a plan that was under review. For FY2022, HHS anticipates about $100 million in federal Title IV-E spending for prevention services will be used to assist some 40,000 children on an average monthly basis. (By contrast, FY2021 federal Title IV-E prevention spending is estimated to be $13 million on behalf of an estimated 7,000 children). 
While the FY2022 budget does not propose changes in child welfare programs with mandatory funding authorities, it does call for $976 million in discretionary funds, which is $212 million above the amount provided for these programs via regular FY2021 appropriations (primarily Division H of P.L. 116-260). This includes a request for $100 million in new competitive grant funding (under Section 426 of the Social Security Act) to demonstrate collaborative (cross-agency) approaches to advance racial equity in child welfare systems, including by re-orienting their work toward family support and prevention of unnecessary foster care placements, and $2 million for a related workforce development and retention initiative. 
Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), the FY2022 budget seeks a combined $200 million for state grants to improve state child protective services systems and for community-based grants to prevent child abuse and neglect (up from $151 million provided for these two grants in regular FY2021 funds). The Administration also seeks $46 million under the Adoption Opportunities program (up from $44 million in FY2021) to address an “urgent” need for states to carry out required “diligent recruitment” of foster and/or adoptive family homes that match the racial and ethnic diversity of children in care needing these homes. In addition to these and other requests for additional discretionary child welfare program funds, the budget seeks $19 million in new program administration funds for HHS-ACF. The new support is requested to assist states and tribes in implementing the Family First Prevention Services Act (Title VII, Division E, P.L. 115-123) and to help states improve child abuse- and neglect-related data collection and tracking.",Child Welfare,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R46838
Reports,R43181,2015-01-15 05:00:00+00:00,Active,The Affordable Care Act and Small Business: Economic Issues,2025-04-18T18:26:13Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R43181,118,"Sean Lowry, Jane G. Gravelle",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R43181/R43181.13.pdf,"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152) contains several provisions to encourage employer-sponsored health coverage, particularly among small businesses. The provisions that most directly relate to small businesses are (1) an employer penalty for not providing health insurance, (2) a tax credit to increase the affordability of health care for the smallest firms, and (3) small business health insurance exchanges designed to increase plan options and lower plan costs.
Several events have altered the ACA’s implementation since its enactment in 2010. Most notably, the Obama Administration delayed the implementation of the employer penalty and part of the small business health exchanges from 2014 to 2015 to allow more time for developing these provisions and allowing firms to come into compliance. Subsequently, the Administration suspended the penalty for employers with fewer than 100 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees for an additional year (until 2016). These delays have added to uncertainty over the potential effects of the ACA on small businesses.
First, this report explains how employer-sponsored insurance can be used to address concerns about health insurance coverage and cost. Second, it summarizes the three ACA provisions most relevant to small businesses, listed above. Next, it analyzes these provisions for their potential effects on small businesses. Finally, this report presents several approaches that could address some concerns associated with these provisions (particularly the employer penalty). 
According to analysis of the most recent employer size and insurance coverage data, the ACA’s employer penalty is structured so that it could exempt approximately 96.2% of employer firms simply because these firms would be too small and thus fall below the employer penalty threshold of 50 FTE employees. These exempt firms account for approximately 27.6% of all workers. After accounting for firms that already provide insurance, less than 1% of employer firms could be subject to the employer penalty. Although 72.4% of all employees work for firms that are large enough to be potentially subject to the penalty, only about 2.4% of employees work in firms that do not already offer health insurance.
Less than 4% of small businesses that could have been eligible for the small business health care tax credit in 2010 actually claimed it. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), many business owners felt that (1) the credit was too small of an incentive to begin offering insurance; (2) even if these small employers offered health insurance, some employees declined coverage because they could not afford their share of the premium; and (3) the rules were too complex. President Obama has proposed simplifying and expanding the credit.
Small business health exchanges could help to reduce some barriers to accessing relatively affordable health coverage in the small-group market. By pooling risk among multiple businesses and reducing administrative costs, average insurance costs could reduce costs for these firms. Firms with relatively healthier employees, however, could see a rise in insurance costs.
One issue of concern is the incentive for firms to reduce part-time employee hours below the 30 hours that define full-time employment (under the ACA) as a means to exclude these employees from coverage. The Save American Workers Act of 2015 (H.R. 30, approved by the House on January 8, 2015) would increase the definition of full-time to at least 40 hours per week. This change would reduce the incentive at 30 hours per week, but it also would introduce an incentive to reduce hours among those who work around 40 hours (a larger share of all workers).","Business & Corporate Tax, Private Health Insurance, Small Business",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R43181

The program allows Medicare to negotiate the prices of certain Medicare drugs directly with drug manufacturers for the first time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tasked with administering the program, has issued guidance to explain the program’s initial implementation. On August 29, 2023, CMS selected the first 10 Medicare Part D drugs that will be subject to negotiated prices in 2026. The agency announced the negotiated prices for those drugs on August 14, 2024. 
In summer 2023, several drug manufacturers and trade associations representing manufacturers challenged the law before federal district courts across the country. The plaintiffs made various arguments in different lawsuits, including that the law is unconstitutional under the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments. They also alleged violations of the Nondelegation Doctrine, the Spending Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. 
The plaintiffs argued that the IRA violates the First Amendment because it forces manufacturers to sign a pricing agreement with the Secretary of HHS that characterizes the negotiated price of the drug as “fair,” which amounts to compelled speech. The plaintiffs also argued that the IRA violates the Fifth Amendment, both the Due Process Clause and the Takings Clause. First, the plaintiffs claimed that the IRA violates the Due Process Clause because it lacks the requisite procedural safeguards, including notice, the opportunity to be heard, and the potential for judicial review. Second, the plaintiffs alleged that the law constitutes a taking of both tangible property (drugs) and intangible property (patents). Some of the plaintiffs claimed that the program amounts to a per se taking, while others argue that it constitutes a regulatory taking. 
A few of the plaintiffs argued that the IRA violates the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause because the excise tax to which manufacturers of selected drugs that do not comply with the statute will be subjected is really a punishment disguised as a tax. The trade association plaintiffs argued that the IRA violates the Nondelegation Doctrine by ceding too much power to the Secretary of HHS to set drug prices. Finally, several plaintiffs argued that the IRA cannot be justified on the basis of Congress’s Spending Clause power because the IRA does not condition the receipt of federal funding on a manufacturer’s participation in the program. The plaintiffs further alleged that even if the IRA could be said to impose such a condition, the statute does not provide adequate notice of the condition, the condition is not related to the purpose of the spending and is unconstitutionally coercive, and compliance with the condition would violate manufacturers’ other rights under the Constitution. 
Of the 10 cases initially filed, one was voluntarily dismissed, two remain pending in federal district court, and seven have been decided at the federal district court level. Some of the decisions issued so far were appealed and, to date, one appeal has been decided; the appellate court remanded the case to the district court. Thus, there are three cases pending in federal district courts at the time of this writing. Of the district court cases decided so far, two did not reach the merits of the constitutional claims because they were dismissed for procedural reasons. As discussed in this report, the other decisions reached the merits of some of the plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges, but none of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims have been successful to date. Six of the decisions issued were appealed to the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, and the cases before the Second, Third, and Sixth Circuits remain pending. Thus far, attempts to enjoin CMS’s implementation of the program have been unsuccessful. Some stakeholders predict that the litigation could eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. 
This report explains and contextualizes the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims by analyzing relevant U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, and it discusses the federal district courts’ resolution of the claims thus far. The Administrative Procedure Act claims are outside the scope of this report but are discussed in other CRS products.

Since March 2020, more than $400 billion has been appropriated for the domestic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health response to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies, mostly as emergency-designated supplemental discretionary appropriations. Much of this funding is available for multiple years or until expended. HHS has allocated funding for vaccines, therapeutics, tests, and health care supports, among other activities. Congress is currently considering additional supplemental appropriations for HHS to support continued COVID-19 response activities. In addition, with the recent public health emergency declared for the monkeypox outbreak, some more recent legislative proposals would provide supplemental appropriations for other emerging diseases in addition to COVID-19. This report summarizes the President’s requests for additional funding, selected congressional proposals in response to that request, and selected policy considerations.

Rennack,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R40089/R40089.11.pdf,"The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) serves as the cornerstone for the United States’ foreign assistance policies and programs. Written, passed, and signed into law at what some consider the height of the Cold War, the act is seen by some today as anachronistic. Ironically, when President Kennedy urged the 87th Congress to enact foreign aid legislation that would exemplify and advance the national interests and security strategies of the United States post-World War II, he described the existing foreign aid mechanisms as bureaucratic, fragmented, awkward, and slow. Some have used the same language today, more than 60 years later, to characterize the legislation he promoted.
On several occasions over the past several decades, Congress has set out to assess the current body of law that comprises foreign aid policy, starting with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Affairs/International Relations and Foreign Relations Committees, in recent past Congresses, have considered legislation to rebuild the United States’ capacity to deliver effective foreign aid, and make aid more transparent and responsive to today’s quick-changing international challenges. Proposals have ranged from setting up advisory committees to a complete overhaul of foreign aid objectives and programs. 
This report presents the authorities of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and correlates those authorities with Foreign Operations Appropriations (division K of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023; P.L. 117-328; 136 Stat. 4459) that fund those authorities. It replaces an earlier issue of the same report, dated April 18, 2012, to incorporate the most recent appropriations act and other enactments of authorities.
For many years, foreign aid appropriations measures have waived the requirement that funds must be authorized before they are appropriated and expended. Understanding the relation between the authorities in the cornerstone act and appropriations is key to foreign aid reform.","Foreign Assistance, State & Foreign Operations Appropriations",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R40089
Reports,R42542,2019-12-26 05:00:00+00:00,Archived,Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): Funding Trends Since FY2002,2025-04-18T21:25:44Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R42542,108,Maggie McCarty,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R42542/R42542.8.pdf,"The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers a number of programs and activities that are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. Most of the funding for HUD’s programs and activities comes from discretionary appropriations provided each year in the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies annual appropriations acts. 
HUD’s annual budget, as considered by congressional appropriators, is generally comprised of several components, including regular annual appropriations, which fund HUD’s regular programs and activities; and rescissions of unspent prior-year funding and offsetting collections and receipts, which together serve to offset the “cost” of that spending. Combined, these components make up HUD’s net budget authority, which is the amount that counts for the purposes of federal budget enforcement, including discretionary spending limitations. HUD also often receives emergency appropriations, which are sometimes provided in response to national emergencies such as disasters and generally do not count for budget enforcement purposes.
This report reviews trends in HUD funding from FY2002 through the most recent completed fiscal year, FY2019. Since FY2002, in terms of nominal dollars, HUD’s regular (non-emergency) annual net budget authority has increased by 50%. However, when adjusting for inflation, HUD’s regular annual net budget authority in FY2019 was about 8% more than it was in FY2002. (See Figure 1.) These figures, though, only tell part of the story of what has happened with HUD funding. 
Gross new appropriations for HUD’s programs and activities have increased since FY2002 by 57% in nominal dollars, 13% in inflation-adjusted dollars. The difference between the increase in appropriations versus net budget authority is due to an increase in the budget savings available from offsetting receipts, primarily attributable to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance program. (See Figure 2.) FHA receipts are used to offset the cost (in terms of budget enforcement) of providing appropriations for HUD’s programs and activities. The offsetting receipts available from FHA increased from a low of about $140 million in FY2010 to a peak of almost $12 billion in FY2014 and have continued to fluctuate in reaction to housing market conditions and administrative policymaking. 
The increase in appropriations for HUD has not been linear. After a period of steady increase, regular appropriations for HUD’s programs and activities peaked in FY2010 and then declined such that in FY2013 they were 15% below the FY2010 level. Over that same period, HUD’s regular annual net budget authority was reduced much more dramatically, by 36%, the difference being attributable to growth in savings from FHA offsetting receipts. FY2013, the year of a discretionary spending sequestration, provided HUD’s lowest level of appropriations since FY2009, and the lowest level of net budget authority since FY2003. Since FY2013, funding for HUD has increased steadily in real and nominal dollars in terms of both net budget authority and regular appropriations for HUD’s programs and activities.
Growth in appropriations for HUD’s programs and activities has largely been driven by increases in appropriations for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and the Section 8 project-based rental assistance program. Combined, the funding for these two rental assistance programs has increased by 120% from FY2002 to FY2019. Conversely, funding for all other HUD programs combined has increased by 4%. The formula grants under HUD’s two largest block grant programs—the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program—have experienced some of the largest reductions in funding during this time (declines of 28% and 22%, respectively). 
Looking toward the future, if policymakers maintain interest in limiting overall discretionary spending, there may be implications for HUD’s budget, particularly in light of specific cost-drivers in HUD’s budget. Cost growth in the two Section 8 programs is likely to continue, as more households are being subsidized through those programs and the cost of the individual subsidies continues to increase. Assuming policymakers continue to prioritize maintaining current service levels in the two Section 8 programs, if discretionary spending limits continue, pressure to reduce funding for other HUD programs and activities, including block grant programs, may also continue. Similarly, if receipts from FHA decline—because of market changes and/or policy changes—pressure to further reduce appropriations for HUD programs may increase.",Housing Budget & Appropriations,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R42542
Reports,R46579,2020-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,Archived,Tanzania: Recent Governance Trends and 2020 Elections In Brief,2025-04-18T20:21:08Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46579,101,Nicolas Cook,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46579/R46579.5.pdf,"Tanzania, an East African country of 58.6 million people, transitioned from a one-party socialist state to a multiparty system in 1992, amidst a then-ongoing liberalization of its state-centric economy. The country has since attracted significant amounts of foreign development aid, including more than $7.5 billion in total U.S. assistance over the past 20 years.
Despite Tanzania’s multiparty transition, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM, Swahili for “Party of the Revolution”) has continued to dominate and control the state. It has won every national election since that transition, as well as all elections in Zanzibar, a semiautonomous, majority Muslim island region. The influence of the CCM has expanded under President John Magufuli, elected in 2015, whose tenure has been controversial. Analysts, advocates, and donor governments have expressed increasing dismay over growing restrictions on political rights and civil liberties and a rise in state human rights abuses under Magufuli, who is seeking a second term in general elections on October 28, 2020. Concern about such trends has prompted the United States and some other donors to curtail or restrict some of their assistance, and a range of observers have questioned the credibility of the 2020 electoral process. Such critics include several Members of Congress, who also have expressed concern over Tanzania’s overall governance trajectory. The State Department has characterized the October 2020 elections as having “important consequences not only for Tanzania, but for the entire East African region,” and called for “the safety of all contestants, respect for the rule of law, and the absolute impartiality of the authorities in charge of managing the elections.”
President Magufuli is running for reelection. His main challenger is Tundu Lissu, of Tanzania’s largest opposition party, Chadema. Lissu returned to Tanzania in July 2020. There are 13 other presidential candidates. In the separate Zanzibar elections, current Minister of Defense Hussein Mwinyi is the CCM’s presidential candidate. His top challenger is Seif Sharif Hamad of ACT-Wazalendo. The start of the national campaign period in late August was tainted by opposition claims that the National Elections Commission (NEC) had unfairly disqualified many of their candidates or prevented their submission of nomination forms, in some cases as a result of alleged intimidation by police or unidentified persons. Many of those initially disqualified appealed, and NEC reinstated 66 parliamentary candidacies, but 20 CCM candidates are running unopposed. Before the official campaign period, police continued to enforce the general ban on political party rallies in place since 2016, drawing U.S. criticism. The ban on rallies has been lifted during campaigning, but police have made multiple arrests during the campaign period, most of opposition candidates and supporters, but in some cases of apparent anti-opposition actors. Electoral authorities are closely monitoring and regulating campaign activities, notably those of opposition candidates, some of whom it has sanctioned for trivial campaign process violations. There has been some electoral violence in Zanzibar, and in mid-October the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC) suspended Hamad’s campaign for five days for an alleged ethics violation, and one ACT-Wazalendo official was arrested for an allegedly seditious social media post. The ZEC’s reported non-issuance of voter IDs in some opposition strongholds has spurred discontent. The state reportedly has deployed military and anti-riot police to Zanzibar.
Several Members of Congress have raised concerns about democratic backsliding and negative human rights trends, in Tanzania, and called for action to help reverse them. In October 2020, Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) chairman Senator Jim Risch stated that “political violence and repression of opposition candidates, restrictions on independent media, lack of autonomy and transparency by electoral officials” in the 2020 elections “reflect Tanzania’s history of flawed elections and... democratic erosion over the past five years.” He called for “electoral officials to correct past errors and return Tanzania to a positive democratic trajectory by holding free, fair, and credible elections.”
On September 17, 2020, Representative Karen Bass, who chairs the Africa subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced H.Res. 1120 H.Res. 1120, Urging the Government of Tanzania and all parties to respect human rights and constitutional rights and ensure free and fair elections in October 2020, and recognizing the importance of multiparty democracy in Tanzania, which highlights deteriorating governance conditions in Tanzania and calls for the October 2020 elections to be “free, fair, credible, transparent, and peaceful.” In late 2019, Representative Karen Bass also introduced H.Res. 768, Calling on African governments to protect and promote human rights through internet freedom and digital integration for all citizens across the continent of Africa, which addresses policy and rights challenges associated with Tanzania’s recent governance trajectory. On September 30, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations held a hearing on Democratic Backsliding in Sub-Saharan Africa that featured discussion of Tanzania.",Sub-Saharan Africa,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R46579
Reports,R46836,2021-07-07 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Mens Rea: An Overview of State-of-Mind Requirements for Federal Criminal Offenses,2025-04-18T20:02:37Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46836,104,Michael A. Foster,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46836/R46836.3.pdf,"The concept of mens rea, or a “guilty mind,” reflects the idea that a crime generally must consist of not only a proscribed act but also a “mental element” sufficient to warrant punishment. Three questions regularly arise with respect to the mental state required for a given federal crime: (1) whether the statute establishing the crime contains a mental-state requirement, or requirements, at all; (2) if the statute does contain mental-state requirements, which elements of the offense must meet which requirements; and (3) what the mental-state requirements mean. Under federal law, determining the mental state required for commission of a crime necessitates an examination of congressional intent.
Congressional intent can be difficult to discern given that federal criminal statutory law (largely codified at Title 18) contains no uniform mens rea standards or generally applicable definitions of mental-state terms. Because federal statutory law lacks general rules for assessing and applying mens rea terms and requirements across criminal statutes, courts have applied canons of statutory interpretation and developed presumptions specific to mens rea when the state of mind requirement for a federal offense is unclear. For example, when a criminal statute is silent on the question of what mental state is required, courts will ordinarily apply a presumption in favor of scienter. The presumption counsels that typically some indication is required that Congress intended to dispense with mens rea as an element of a crime, and simply omitting a mens rea term from the statutory language will not be considered adequate evidence of such intent. Assuming the presumption of mens rea applies and calls for a mental-state requirement to be read into a statute that does not expressly contain one, the question becomes what kind of mental state is required. In this respect, the Supreme Court has said that the presumption requires “only that mens rea which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from otherwise innocent conduct’”—typically, at least knowledge of certain elements of the offense at issue. 
With respect to which elements of a crime must meet a given mens rea requirement, the Supreme Court has stated that the presumption in favor of scienter applies to “each of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct,” though such a distributive approach emphasizing a distinction between elements that make conduct criminal and those that do not can sometimes be difficult to apply in practice. Finally, regarding what specific mental-state requirements mean, federal law uses dozens of different mens rea terms that are frequently undefined. As such, reference to judicial precedent construing the provision at issue is often required to understand what mental state is required for a particular federal crime. Even so, federal mens rea requirements largely fall into loose categories that may include (1) an awareness of, or conscious purpose to bring about, conduct, a circumstance, or a result that is a required element of the offense (commonly represented by terms such as “intent,” “knowledge,” or “willfulness,” among others), or (2) an awareness and disregard of a substantial risk of harm or failure to perceive a substantial risk of harm when a reasonable person would have perceived it (commonly represented by the terms “recklessness” and “negligence,” respectively). 
A class of “public welfare” or “regulatory” offenses may actually require no mens rea for their commission at all. For this class of offenses, rather than applying the presumption in favor of scienter, statutory silence is treated as imposing “strict criminal liability” in the sense that one need not have at least knowledge of the facts that make one’s conduct illegal. Ultimately, several factors may be relevant to a court’s determination of whether a particular criminal statute imposes strict liability, including the nature of the statute and the particular activity or item regulated, the purpose of the criminal prohibition (i.e., punishment of wrongdoing versus protection of the public), the degree to which a defendant will be in a position to ascertain the relevant facts, and the severity of the penalties.
In the past, Congress has considered legislation that would have established default mens rea requirements and application rules in the absence of clear standards in the offense text, and at least one bill (S. 739) has been introduced to this effect in the 117th Congress. Among other things, such legislation would impose standards of either knowledge or willfulness on many offense elements and would require that mens rea terms provided in the text should ordinarily apply to each offense element, with exceptions. Proponents of such efforts argue that strict-liability offenses and offenses with weak mental-state requirements fail to provide fair notice and represent part of a broader trend of federal over-criminalization. Opponents assert that applying blanket mens rea requirements to existing offenses could permit corporate wrongdoers to evade prosecution and produce unintended consequences. Ultimately, comprehensive mens rea legislation has not become law as of this writing.",Crime,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R46836

Hickey, Erin H. Ward",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46741/R46741.2.pdf,"Intellectual property (IP) rights play an important role in the development and pricing of pharmaceuticals, such as prescription drugs and biological products (biologics). To provide incentives for research and development (R&D), IP law grants innovators exclusive rights that may prevent others from making generic or biosimilar versions of a drug or biologic, enabling makers of brand-name pharmaceuticals to charge higher prices in some circumstances. In the pharmaceutical context, such higher-than-competitive prices are intended to allow pharmaceutical manufacturers an opportunity to recoup substantial R&D costs, including clinical trials and other tests necessary to obtain regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although many factors other than IP rights contribute to the cost of prescription drugs and biologics, pharmaceutical products are frequently protected by IP rights, and IP rights are often among the most important factors driving high drug prices. 
New pharmaceutical products may benefit from two main forms of IP protection: patents and regulatory exclusivities. Patents are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to a wide range of inventions that are new, useful, nonobvious, and directed at patent-eligible subject matter. The holder of a valid patent generally has the exclusive right to make, use, sell, or import a patented invention within the United States for a roughly 20-year term. Regulatory exclusivities are granted by FDA for certain categories of pharmaceuticals upon the completion of the regulatory process required before manufacturers can market drugs and biologics in the United States. Generally, regulatory exclusivities prevent FDA from accepting or approving an application for a generic or biosimilar product, or preclude a competitor from relying on safety and efficacy data submitted by the original manufacturer, for a set period. There are many different types of regulatory exclusivities, ranging from six months to 12 years, depending on the type of pharmaceutical product and other factors. 
Because of the connection between drug pricing and IP rights, many legislative proposals in the 116th Congress that sought to affect drug pricing focused on reforms to pharmaceutical patents and regulatory exclusivities. For example, a number of bills sought to change the use or enforcement of patent rights in pharmaceuticals, such as by increasing patent transparency; curtailing alleged tactics such as “evergreening,” “product hopping,” “patent thickets,” or “pay-for-delay” settlements; or altering procedures for PTO administrative challenges to pharmaceutical patents. Other bills would have changed the scope or length of various FDA regulatory exclusivities, including those for the new biological products, new chemical entities, or orphan drugs. Still other bills would have allowed the federal government to limit IP rights based on pricing, imposed conditions on IP rights arising from government-supported innovation, or directed the federal government itself to directly manufacture generic drugs and biosimilars. Finally, some bills focused primarily on IP rights in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) countermeasures (such as treatments and vaccines) or combined IP provisions with other drug-pricing or health care provisions not directly related to IP rights.
Dozens of pharmaceutical IP bills were introduced, more than a dozen were reported out of committee, several were passed by the Senate or the House of Representatives, and at least four were enacted into law. Issues relating to drug pricing and IP may continue to be debated in the 117th Congress. To facilitate consideration of these issues, this report summarizes legislative proposals introduced in the 116th Congress that concern drug pricing and relate to patent and regulatory exclusivity rights in drugs and biologics. Among other things, this report classifies bills by legislative status and type, and analyzes and compares bills addressing similar subject matter.

Reports,RL32221,2024-10-15 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Visa Waiver Program,2025-04-18T21:55:33Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/RL32221,153,Abigail F. Kolker,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/RL/PDF/RL32221/RL32221.48.pdf,"The Visa Waiver Program (VWP), established in 1986 as a trial program and made permanent in 2000 (P.L. 106-396), allows nationals from 42 countries to enter the United States for periods of up to 90 days as temporary visitors (nonimmigrants) for business or pleasure without first obtaining a visa. Generally, temporary visitors for business or pleasure must obtain a visa from Department of State (DOS) officers at a consular post abroad before traveling to the United States unless they are nationals of one of the countries that participates in the VWP. 
Two main goals of the VWP are increasing tourism and strengthening national security. Some observers argue that the VWP strengthens national security because it sets standards for travel documents, requires information sharing between the member countries and the United States on criminal and security concerns, and mandates reporting of lost and stolen travel documents. VWP travelers have to present e-passports (i.e., passports with a data chip containing biometric information), which tend to be more difficult to alter than other types of passports. Nevertheless, some observers of the program have raised concerns about the possibility that terrorists will enter the United States under the VWP because those entering under the VWP undergo a biographic, rather than a biometric (i.e., fingerprint and digital photograph), security screening and do not need to interview in person with a U.S. consular official before embarking for the United States. 
There is also interest in the VWP as a mechanism to promote tourism and commerce and to ease consular workloads abroad. In the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, VWP admissions constituted approximately one-third of all temporary visitor admissions. For example, in FY2019 there were more than 22.9 million admissions to the United States under this program, constituting 31% of all temporary visitor admissions. In FY2021, the number of VWP admissions dropped significantly (to 1 million), constituting nearly 9.7% of all temporary visitor admissions, likely due to the impacts of COVID-19 on international travel. VWP admissions began to rebound in FY2022 (11.5 million), constituting 29.3% of all temporary visitor admissions. 
To qualify for the VWP, a country must offer reciprocal travel privileges to U.S. citizens; have had a nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of less than 3% for the previous year; issue their nationals machine-readable passports that incorporate biometric identifiers; issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable visa documents that incorporate biometric identifiers which are verifiable at the country’s port of entry; report the loss and theft of passports; share specified information regarding nationals of the country who represent a threat to U.S. security; and not compromise the law enforcement or security interests of the United States by its inclusion in the program. Countries can be terminated from the VWP if they fail to meet any of these conditions or otherwise threaten the United States’ security or immigration interests. 
All foreign nationals (i.e., aliens) entering under the VWP must present passports that contain electronic data chips (e-passports). Under Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations, travelers who seek to enter the United States through the VWP are subject to the biometric requirements of the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program. In addition, aliens seeking to travel to the United States under the VWP must get an approval from the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), a web-based system that checks the alien’s information against relevant law enforcement and security databases, before they can board a plane to the United States.
Under statute, the Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive the nonimmigrant visa refusal rate requirement, provided certain conditions are met. However, the waiver authority was suspended on July 1, 2009, because DHS had not fully implemented an air exit system that incorporates biometric identifiers (an air exit system that can verify the departure of not less than 97% of foreign nationals who exit through U.S. airports was one of the conditions for granting the Secretary waiver authority). The waiver will not be available until such a system is implemented, and it is unknown when a biometric air exit system will be completed and fully implemented.

Mix",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R45745/R45745.6.pdf,"For the past 70 years, the United States has been instrumental in leading and promoting a strong U.S.-European partnership. Often termed the transatlantic relationship, this partnership has been grounded in the U.S.-led post-World War II order based on alliances with like-minded democratic countries and a shared U.S.-European commitment to free markets and an open international trading system. Transatlantic relations encompass the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), close U.S. bilateral ties with most countries in Western and Central Europe, and a massive, interdependent trade and investment partnership. Despite periodic U.S.-European tensions, successive U.S. Administrations and many Members of Congress have supported the broad transatlantic relationship, viewing it as enhancing U.S. security and stability and magnifying U.S. global influence and financial clout.
Transatlantic Relations and the Trump Administration
The transatlantic relationship currently faces significant challenges. President Trump and some members of his Administration have questioned NATO’s strategic value, and they have expressed considerable skepticism about the EU and the multilateral trading system. President Trump repeatedly voices concern that the United States bears an undue share of the transatlantic security burden and that EU trade policies are unfair to U.S. workers and businesses. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, could have implications for U.S. security and economic interests in Europe. U.S.-European divisions have emerged on regional and global issues, from aspects of relations with Russia and China to policies on Iran, Syria, arms control, and climate change. Managing the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further strained relations.
The Trump Administration asserts that its policies toward Europe seek to ensure that European allies and partners are equipped to work with the United States in confronting the challenges posed by an increasingly competitive world. U.S. officials maintain that the U.S. commitment to NATO and European security remains steadfast; the Trump Administration has backed new NATO initiatives to deter Russian aggression, supported the accession of two new members to the alliance, and increased U.S. troop deployments in Europe. The Administration also contends that it is committed to working with the EU, as signaled by its intention to pursue a U.S.-EU trade liberalization agreement. Supporters credit President Trump’s approach toward Europe with strengthening NATO and compelling the EU to address U.S. trade concerns.
Critics argue that the Administration’s policies are endangering decades of U.S.-European consultation and cooperation that have advanced key U.S. geostrategic and economic interests. Some analysts suggest that current U.S.-European divisions are detrimental to transatlantic cohesion and represent a win for potential adversaries such as Russia and China. Many European leaders worry about potential U.S. global disengagement, and some increasingly argue that Europe must be better prepared to address both regional and international challenges on its own.
Congressional Interests
The implications of Trump Administration policies toward Europe and the extent to which the transatlantic relationship contributes to promoting U.S. security and prosperity may be of interest to the 116th Congress. Broad bipartisan support exists in Congress for NATO, and many Members of Congress view the EU as an important U.S. partner, especially given extensive U.S.-EU trade and investment ties. At the same time, some Members have long advocated for greater European burdensharing in NATO, or may oppose European or EU policies on certain foreign policy or trade issues. Areas for potential congressional oversight include the future U.S. role in NATO, as well as prospects for U.S.-European cooperation on challenges such as managing a resurgent Russia and an increasingly competitive China. Based on its constitutional role over tariffs and foreign commerce, Congress has a direct interest in monitoring proposed new U.S.-EU trade agreement negotiations. In addition, Congress may consider how the Administration’s trade and tariff policies could affect the U.S.-EU economic relationship.

Reports,R45129,2018-03-15 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Modes of Constitutional Interpretation,2025-04-18T18:15:32Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R45129,104,Brandon J. Murrill,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R45129/R45129.3.pdf,"When exercising its power to review the constitutionality of governmental action, the Supreme Court has relied on certain “methods” or “modes” of interpretation—that is, ways of figuring out a particular meaning of a provision within the Constitution. This report broadly describes the most common modes of constitutional interpretation; discusses examples of Supreme Court decisions that demonstrate the application of these methods; and provides a general overview of the various arguments in support of, and in opposition to, the use of such methods of constitutional interpretation.
Textualism. Textualism is a mode of interpretation that focuses on the plain meaning of the text of a legal document. Textualism usually emphasizes how the terms in the Constitution would be understood by people at the time they were ratified, as well as the context in which those terms appear. Textualists usually believe there is an objective meaning of the text, and they do not typically inquire into questions regarding the intent of the drafters, adopters, or ratifiers of the Constitution and its amendments when deriving meaning from the text.
Original Meaning. Whereas textualist approaches to constitutional interpretation focus solely on the text of the document, originalist approaches consider the meaning of the Constitution as understood by at least some segment of the populace at the time of the Founding. Originalists generally agree that the Constitution’s text had an “objectively identifiable” or public meaning at the time of the Founding that has not changed over time, and the task of judges and Justices (and other responsible interpreters) is to construct this original meaning.
Judicial Precedent. The most commonly cited source of constitutional meaning is the Supreme Court’s prior decisions on questions of constitutional law. For most, if not all Justices, judicial precedent provides possible principles, rules, or standards to govern judicial decisions in future cases with arguably similar facts.
Pragmatism. Pragmatist approaches often involve the Court weighing or balancing the probable practical consequences of one interpretation of the Constitution against other interpretations. One flavor of pragmatism weighs the future costs and benefits of an interpretation to society or the political branches, selecting the interpretation that may lead to the perceived best outcome. Under another type of pragmatist approach, a court might consider the extent to which the judiciary could play a constructive role in deciding a question of constitutional law.
Moral Reasoning. This approach argues that certain moral concepts or ideals underlie some terms in the text of the Constitution (e.g., “equal protection” or “due process of law”), and that these concepts should inform judges’ interpretations of the Constitution.
National Identity (or “Ethos”). Judicial reasoning occasionally relies on the concept of a “national ethos,” which draws upon the distinct character and values of the American national identity and the nation’s institutions in order to elaborate on the Constitution’s meaning.
Structuralism. Another mode of constitutional interpretation draws inferences from the design of the Constitution: the relationships among the three branches of the federal government (commonly called separation of powers); the relationship between the federal and state governments (known as federalism); and the relationship between the government and the people.
Historical Practices. Prior decisions of the political branches, particularly their long-established, historical practices, are an important source of constitutional meaning. Courts have viewed historical practices as a source of the Constitution’s meaning in cases involving questions about the separation of powers, federalism, and individual rights, particularly when the text provides no clear answer.",,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R45129
Reports,R46300,2024-10-08 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Adding Countries to the Visa Waiver Program: National Security and Tourism Considerations,2025-04-18T21:55:09Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46300,114,"Abigail F. Kolker, Adam G. Levin",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46300/R46300.10.pdf,"The Visa Waiver Program (VWP), which allows citizens of certain countries to visit the United States for up to three months without a visa, has two explicit missions: to enhance national security and to boost the U.S. travel and tourism sectors. A concern for Congress is whether the VWP, in contrast to its mission, exposes the United States to security threats despite implementation of strict security requirements for participating countries over recent years. At the same time, because of long-standing congressional interest in promoting the U.S. travel and tourism sectors, many lawmakers support adding more countries to the VWP. On September 24, 2024, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, designated Qatar into the VWP, bringing the number of participating countries to 42.
A key goal of the VWP is to improve standards for aviation security and travel documents, and improve information-sharing by law enforcement in countries around the world. To qualify for the VWP, countries must issue electronic passports, report information on all lost and stolen passports to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), and share information on travelers who may pose a terrorist or criminal threat. Every VWP traveler must obtain preclearance to board a flight to the United States through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Supporters of the VWP see admission into the program as an incentive for foreign countries to increase their security infrastructure and information-sharing with the United States. A competing view is that despite security improvements, including generally disallowing individuals to travel under the VWP if they had traveled to a country known as a terrorist sanctuary, the program remains a national security vulnerability.
Foreign travel from VWP countries to the United States—as with foreign travel to the United States from non-VWP countries—has fluctuated over the past five years. In 2019, there were 23.8 million arrivals to the United States from VWP countries. In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic struck, there were 4.0 million arrivals to the United States from VWP countries. In 2023, the number of arrivals to the United States from VWP countries had rebounded to 18.4 million. Assessing recent visitor trends does not necessarily yield clear conclusions on VWP’s impact on U.S. tourism. For example, the average number of arrivals to the United States from non-VWP countries has increased at a higher rate over the past decade than it has from VWP countries. 
In recent Congresses, some legislative proposals related to the VWP have sought to expand the number of participating countries or to add restrictions to VWP membership. Other proposals have related to VWP’s security goals. In addition, in recent years Congress has passed tourism-related legislation, which became law that affected both VWP and non-VWP countries. In the 117th Congress, the Restoring Brand USA Act (Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 [P.L. 117-103]) provided access to $250 million in one-time funding to the Corporation for Travel Promotion, a national tourism promotion program also known as Brand USA. Also in the 117th Congress, the Visit America Act (Subtitle A, Title VI, Division BB of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 [P.L. 117-328]) authorized the creation of a new Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism within the Department of Commerce with responsibility for, among other things, establishing an annual goal for international visitors to the United States and producing an annual forecast of the U.S. tourism industry. At the end of the 116th Congress, in December 2019, Congress authorized the continued use of the ESTA fee to partially fund Brand USA through September 30, 2027. Congress also raised the ESTA fee to generate additional funding for Brand USA, which went into effect on May 20, 2022.

Reports,R47511,2023-04-20 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Subsistence Uses of Resources in Alaska: An Overview of Federal Management,2025-04-18T20:40:09Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R47511,109,"Mark K. DeSantis, Erin H. Ward",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47511/R47511.4.pdf,"Certain federal statutes provide avenues for individuals to engage in subsistence uses of natural resources. The term subsistence uses or subsistence in federal statutes and regulations generally refers to the practice of relying on the surrounding environment as a source of food and materials for daily life. For some, the term subsistence uses includes only such nutritional or economic purposes. For others, the concept of subsistence use extends beyond sustenance to encompass activities tied to their historical and cultural identities. 
More than any other state, Alaska’s residents rely on subsistence uses of natural resources—including the hunting, fishing, harvesting, trading, and consumption of fish, wildlife, and plant life—for their daily nutritional needs. According to federal estimates, rural Alaskans harvest approximately 18,000 tons of wild foods annually for subsistence uses. Although the State of Alaska generally manages subsistence harvests on state lands and certain private lands, the federal government is responsible for managing subsistence uses on federal lands and waters and across all lands for certain species. 
Congress has passed numerous statutes that either directly or indirectly provide for the protection and/or recognition of subsistence uses on lands and waters in Alaska. Some of these laws, such as the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA; P.L. 96-487), apply only to subsistence uses of resources located on lands owned and managed by the federal government. Other federal laws may apply to subsistence uses of specific species both on and off federal lands. For example, the Endangered Species Act (ESA; 16 U.S.C. §§1531-1544), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA; 16 U.S.C. §§1361 et seq.), and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA; 16 U.S.C. §§703-712) provide exceptions from certain prohibited activities under the acts to allow qualifying individuals in Alaska to engage in specified subsistence uses of species protected by the acts.
Given the cultural and economic importance of subsistence uses in Alaska, issues related to the protection and management of subsistence use are of significant interest at the local, state, and federal levels. Many of these issues revolve around whether, or the degree to which, the federal government should have a role in managing the subsistence use of resources. Others relate to the extent of the federal government’s jurisdiction and whether the federal government has the authority to regulate certain lands and waters for subsistence use purposes. Additional concerns have arisen when state and federal regulations for subsistence uses conflict, particularly in instances when state and federal lands are abutting. Federal agencies also may face challenges balancing their statutory obligations under the various laws that govern the management of lands under their jurisdiction, some of which they may view as conflicting with subsistence hunting, fishing, harvesting and other related subsistence use activities. 
Other issues in recent years have focused on the importance of subsistence uses to Alaska Native communities. In particular, some Alaska Native communities have criticized the term subsistence for not adequately capturing how such practices are integrated into their cultural, religious, and social systems. These communities also have raised concerns as to whether the current statutory framework adequately protects and prioritizes their traditional subsistence practices and culture. Some Alaska Native communities have suggested that the extension of subsistence use priorities or exemptions under federal law to non-Alaska Native communities does not satisfy commitments the federal government made to Alaska Native communities. 
Other concerns have been raised regarding the federal government’s ability to regulate subsistence uses effectively due to the size of the federal estate, the complexity of the subsistence use legal framework, and general law enforcement challenges in Alaska. In addition, issues related to climate change have created challenges for traditional subsistence use practices in Alaska and have potential implications for federal land management agencies’ subsistence use responsibilities.

Reports,R41913,2017-05-16 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Regulation of Debit Interchange Fees,2025-04-18T18:18:18Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R41913,112,Darryl E. Getter,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R41913/R41913.11.pdf,"The United States has seen continued growth of electronic card payments (and a simultaneous decrease in check payments). From 2009 through 2012, debit card transactions have outpaced other payment forms. When a consumer uses a debit card in a transaction, the merchant pays a “swipe” fee, which is also known as the interchange fee. The interchange fee is paid to the card-issuing bank (i.e., the consumer’s bank that issued the debit card) as compensation for facilitating the transaction. Section 1075 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (or Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-203), also known as the Durbin Amendment, authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to prescribe regulations to ensure that the amount of any interchange transaction fee received by a debit card issuer is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer.
The Federal Reserve may consider the authorization, clearance, and settlement costs of each transaction when it sets the interchange fee. The Durbin Amendment allows the interchange fee to be adjusted for costs incurred by debit card issuers to prevent fraud. Debit card issuers with less than $10 billion in assets are exempt by statute from the regulation, which means that smaller financial institutions may receive a larger interchange fee than larger issuers. The legislation also prohibits network providers (e.g., Visa and MasterCard) and debit card issuers from imposing restrictions that would override a merchant’s choice of the network provider through which to route transactions.
On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule implementing the Durbin Amendment by Regulation II, which includes a cap of 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction (and an additional 1 cent to account for fraud protection costs) on the interchange fee for large issuers. The rule went into effect on October 1, 2011. Merchants expected to benefit from the Durbin Amendment by having to pay a lower swipe fee. Large debit card issuers expected to lose revenue under the regulated cap. Many small debit card issuers that were exempt from the rule had also opposed the Durbin Amendment given concerns about the feasibility of a sustainable two-tiered interchange pricing system. Since implementation of the rule, merchants have seen a limited and unequal impact on the amount they pay in swipe fees. Likewise, the impact of Regulation II has been uneven for covered institutions. Institutions not covered by the Regulation II have reportedly observed minimal change in revenues generated by debit transactions.
H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, would repeal the Durbin Amendment. Specifically, Section 735 of the Financial CHOICE Act would repeal Section 1075 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. On May 4, 2017, H.R. 10 was ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee.

Marples,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/RS/PDF/RS22689/RS22689.24.pdf,"Private equity and hedge funds are investment pools generally available only to institutions and individuals able to make investments in excess of $200,000. Private equity funds acquire ownership stakes in other companies and seek to profit by improving operating results or through financial restructuring. Hedge funds follow many strategies, investing in any market where managers see profit opportunities. The two kinds of funds are generally structured as partnerships: the fund managers act as general partners, while the outside investors are limited partners. Fund managers are compensated in two ways. First, to the extent that they invest their own capital in the funds, they share in the appreciation of fund assets. Second, they charge the outside investors two kinds of annual fees: a percentage of total fund assets, and a percentage of the fund’s earnings. The latter performance fee is called “carried interest” and is treated as capital gains under current tax rules.
Since the 110th Congress, concerns have been raised that the current tax rules are inequitable and inconsistent with some tax policy principles. Proposals that address this concern have focused on taxing some portion (or all in some cases) of carried interest as ordinary income. In the 113th Congress, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 would tax carried interest, exempting income earned from real estate, as ordinary income. S. 268 and the President’s FY2014 Budget Proposal would tax carried interest as ordinary income, while taxing another form of compensation, known as enterprise value, as capital gains income. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provision in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 would raise $3.1 billion in revenue in the FY2014-FY2023 budget window, while the provision in the President’s FY2014 Budget Proposal would raise $17.4 billion in revenue in the FY2014-FY2023 budget window.

Lynch,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R41186/R41186.10.pdf,"The purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance Congress’s ability to bring existing spending, revenue, and debt-limit laws into compliance with current fiscal priorities established in the annual budget resolution. When Congress adopts a budget resolution, it is agreeing upon its budgetary goals for the upcoming fiscal year. In some cases, for these goals to be achieved, Congress must pass legislation that alters current revenue, direct spending, or debt-limit laws. Reconciliation instructions are the means by which Congress can establish the roles that specific committees will play in achieving these goals.
Budget reconciliation is an optional, congressional process that consists of several different stages. The first stage in the reconciliation process is the adoption of the budget resolution. If Congress intends to utilize the reconciliation process to achieve its budgetary goals, reconciliation directives (also referred to as reconciliation instructions) must be included in the annual budget resolution.
To achieve the budgetary goals set forth in the budget resolution, reconciliation directives designate which committee(s) should report reconciliation legislation, the date by which the committee(s) should report, the dollar amount of budgetary change to be achieved in the reconciliation legislation, and the time period over which the impact of the budgetary change should be measured. They might also include language identifying the type of budgetary change that should be reported as well as other procedural provisions, contingencies, and programmatic direction. This report discusses these various components of reconciliation instructions.
There is no procedural mechanism for requiring a committee to report reconciliation legislation on time, or at all. Each chamber, however, has methods that it can employ to allow it to move forward with reconciliation legislation and to include legislative language that falls within the non-reporting committee’s jurisdiction, in the event that a committee has not reported. These methods vary by chamber.

As both houses debate differing versions of water resources and development bills (S. 2800, H.R. 8) and the FY2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill (S. 2975, H.R. 5895), the decision about which of these projects could be undertaken first will likely be among the most controversial issues.
The inland waterway system supports barge transportation of heavy raw materials such as grain, coal, petroleum, and construction aggregates. The new locks are needed, according to the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and barge shippers, where existing locks are in poor condition, requiring frequent closures for repairs, and/or because a lock’s size causes delays for barge tows. The total estimated cost for the 21 planned lock projects is several billion dollars (many of the individual projects have a cost estimate of between $300 million and $800 million). However, available funding for these projects is about $200 million per year. This is because of limited appropriations and cost-sharing capabilities. Under current cost-share arrangements, the barge industry pays half the cost of construction projects. It does this by paying a $0.29 per gallon fuel tax, which annually generates around $100 million.
Significant changes in traffic levels through particular locks may affect the benefits that were estimated as expansion projects were advanced. The calculation of benefits is critical to advancing a project: the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will not request funding for a project unless the estimated economic benefit is at least 2.5 times the expected cost. The lock projects are clustered in three regions, each facing different economic conditions that are affecting barge traffic
in the agricultural heartland, record corn and soybean harvests have reversed the long-term downward trend of cargo volumes on the Upper Mississippi River;
in the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys, the domestic natural gas boom has reduced the demand for coal by barge to power plants by nearly half;
along the Texas and Louisiana intracoastal waterway, tank barge traffic is still in a state of flux as the petrochemical industry makes longer-term investments related to the Texas shale oil boom.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is expecting corn and soybean exports to increase slightly over the next decade, but this projection could be affected by possible Chinese tariff increases on U.S. agricultural goods, including soybeans. The closing of additional coal-fired electric power plants along the Ohio, Monongahela, and Tennessee Rivers would reduce waterway use, as the power plants generate 75% or more of the barge traffic through many of the locks on these rivers. The loss of coal traffic is significant for other commodities as well, as it could lead to more empty repositioning of barges, reducing economies of density for barge transport on the rivers. New pipeline construction and the lifting of the crude oil export ban at the end of 2015 are two factors that could influence barge demand over the long-term on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.",Freight,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R45211

Changes to the Architect’s appointment process have been periodically discussed for many years, and congressional interest increased with the termination of the service of former Architect J. Brett Blanton on February 13, 2023. 
The resulting Architect of the Capitol Appointment Act of 2023 was enacted within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (H.R. 2670, P.L. 118-31) on December 22, 2023. The act places responsibility for the appointment of the Architect within a congressional commission comprised of 12 Members. Under the new procedure, the appointment is pursuant to a majority vote of the commission, as is reappointment or removal. The act continued the 10-year term for the Architect and amended the existing law related to the appointment and service of the Deputy Architect.
The first appointment under this new process was announced by the congressional commission on May 22, 2024. Thomas Austin assumed the role of Architect on June 24. 
Prior to the 2023 change, pursuant to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1990, the Architect was appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Before the enactment of this law in 1989, the President appointed the Architect for an unlimited term with no formal role for Congress.
The 1989 act first established a 10-year term for the Architect as well as a bicameral, bipartisan congressional commission to recommend candidates to the President. As subsequently amended in 1995, this law provided for a commission consisting of 14 Members of Congress, including the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the House and Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chair and ranking minority members of the Committee on House Administration, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Architect was eligible to be reappointed.
Alan M. Hantman was the first Architect appointed under the 1989 appointment procedure. He declined to seek reappointment and served from January 30, 1997, to February 4, 2007. 
Stephen T. Ayers, who served as Acting Architect of the Capitol following Mr. Hantman’s retirement, was nominated by President Obama on February 24, 2010, for a 10-year term. The nomination was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The committee held a hearing on April 15, 2010, during which the chair and ranking member praised Mr. Ayers for his work as acting Architect and congratulated him on the nomination. Mr. Ayers was confirmed by voice vote in the Senate on May 12, 2010. 
Upon Mr. Ayers’s retirement on November 23, 2018, Christine Merdon, the Deputy Architect of the Capitol/Chief Operating Officer, became the Acting Architect of the Capitol. After her resignation in August 2019, Thomas J. Carroll served as Acting Architect of the Capitol.
J. Brett Blanton was nominated to be Architect of the Capitol by President Trump on December 9, 2019. The nomination was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The committee held a hearing on December 12, 2019, and Mr. Blanton was confirmed by voice vote in the Senate on December 19, 2019. On February 13, 2023, Mr. Blanton was informed by the White House that his appointment as Architect was terminated. 
Chere Rexroat, the Chief Engineer, was initially named the Acting Architect. She was succeeded in February 2024 by Acting Architect of the Capitol and Chief of Operations Joseph DiPietro.

The reconciliation directives included in the budget resolution specify several things, including the committee instructed to report reconciliation legislation, the level of budgetary changes the committee should report, and the date by which the committee should report.
Although reconciliation directives included in an annual budget resolution direct a committee to report legislation achieving a specific budgetary outcome by a specific date, there is no procedural mechanism for enforcing this date. Committees have often reported reconciliation legislation in response to their directives after the date specified with no impact on whether the resultant legislation was considered under House and Senate procedures as reconciliation legislation. 
In some years, committees have not formally responded to the reconciliation directive instructing them to report legislation. Although there is no procedural mechanism for enforcing the date included in the committee’s reconciliation directive, Congress may employ methods of moving forward with reconciliation legislation that falls within a non-reporting committee’s jurisdiction in the event that the committee has not yet reported. These methods vary by chamber and are employable only in certain situations.
Both the legislative committees and the Budget Committees in both chambers have important roles to play in using the reconciliation process. This report examines the timing of certain stages of the reconciliation process and the extent to which the submission due date included in a reconciliation instruction is a predictor for the timing of committee response. Specifically, it provides information on the dates by which committees have been directed to respond to reconciliation directives and the timing of House and Senate committees in responding to such directives in the past 14 Congresses (101st-114th Congresses).

The Convention contains procedures for processing international child support cases that are intended to be uniform, simple, efficient, accessible, and cost-free to U.S. citizens seeking child support in other countries. The United States was the first country to sign the Convention. For many international cases, U.S. courts and state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies already recognize and enforce child support obligations, whether or not the United States has a reciprocal agreement with the other country. However, many foreign countries will not enforce U.S. child support orders in the absence of a treaty obligation.
On August 30, 2016, President Obama signed the instrument of ratification for the Convention. On September 7, 2016, the United States deposited its instrument of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is the depository for the Convention. Thirty-three other countries, including the European Union, have also ratified the Convention.
Although it is not the Senate’s role to ratify treaties, it provides its advice and consent to a treaty’s provisions. On September 29, 2010, the U.S. Senate approved the Resolution of Advice and Consent regarding the Convention.
Implementing legislation for the Convention was included in the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (H.R. 4980), which was enacted into law on September 29, 2014, as P.L. 113-183. H.R. 4980 was passed by the House on July 23, 2014 (by voice vote under suspension of the rules), and by the Senate on September 18, 2014 (by unanimous consent). P.L. 113-183 included provisions that would implement the Convention. Specifically, it contains several provisions related to the international enforcement of child support orders. It contains provisions designed to improve child support collections in cases where the custodial parent and child live in one country and the noncustodial parent lives in another country. It ensures that the United States is compliant with the Convention and any other multilateral child support enforcement treaty and requires states to update their Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) law to incorporate any amendments adopted as of September 2008 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.

Reports,R46249,2020-03-03 05:00:00+00:00,Archived,U.S. Farm Income Outlook: February 2020 Forecast,2025-04-18T21:12:38Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R46249,104,Randy Schnepf,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46249/R46249.3.pdf,"This report uses the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) farm income projections (as of February 5, 2020) to describe the U.S. farm economic outlook for 2020. Two major indicators of U.S. farm well-being are net farm income and net cash income. Net farm income represents an accrual of the value of all goods and serviced produced on the farm during the year—similar in concept to gross domestic product. In contrast, net cash income uses a cash flow concept to measure farm well-being: Only cash transactions for the year are included. Thus, crop production is recorded as net farm income immediately after harvest, whereas net cash income records a crop’s value only after it has been sold in the marketplace.
According to USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), national net farm income is forecast at $96.7 billion in 2020, up $3.1 billion (+3.3%) from 2019. The forecast rise in 2020 net farm income stands in contrast with a projected decline of over $10.8 billion in net cash income (-9.0%). Last year’s (2019) net cash income forecast included $14.7 billion in sales of on-farm crop inventories, which helped to inflate the 2019 net cash income value to $120.4 billion. The 2020 net cash income forecast includes a much smaller amount ($0.5 billion) in sales from on-farm inventories, thus contributing to the decline from 2019.
Government direct support payments to the agricultural sector are expected to continue to play an important role in farm income projections. USDA projects $15 billion in farm support outlays for 2020, including the $3.7 billion of 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments—the third and final tranche of payments under the $14.5 billion program. If realized, the 2020 government payments of $15 billion would represent a 36.6% decline from 2019 but would still be the second largest since 2006. The $23.6 billion in federal payments in 2019 was the largest taxpayer transfer to the agriculture sector (in absolute dollars) since 2005. The surge in federal subsidies in 2019 was driven by large payments (estimated at $14.3 billion) under the MFP initiated by USDA in response to the U.S.-China trade dispute. The Administration has not announced a new MFP for 2020.
Weather conditions and planting prospects for 2020 are unknown this early in the year. Commodity prices are under pressure from abundant global supplies and uncertain export prospects. Despite the signing of a Phase I trade agreement with China on January 15, 2020, it is unclear how soon—if at all—the United States may resume normal trade with China or how international demand may evolve in 2020.
Farm asset value in 2020 is projected up year-to-year at $3.1 trillion (+1.3%). Farm asset values reflect farm investors’ and lenders’ expectations about long-term profitability of farm sector investments. Another critical measure of the farm sector’s well-being is aggregate farm debt, which is projected to be at a record $425.3 billion in 2020—up 2.3% from 2019. Both the debt-to-asset and the debt-to-equity ratios have risen for eight consecutive years, potentially suggesting a continued slow erosion of the U.S. farm sector’s financial situation. 
At the farm household level, average farm household incomes have been well above average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. However, this advantage derives primarily from off-farm income as a share of farm household total income. Since 2014, over half of U.S. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations. 
USDA Farm Income Projections as of February 5, 2020
This report discusses aggregate national net farm income projections for calendar year 2020 as forecast by ERS on February 5, 2020. It is the first of three ERS forecasts for 2020: The second farm income forecast is expected on September 2, 2020, and the third is expected in November.

McGarry, Pat Towell",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R45816/R45816.2.pdf,"For FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $708.1 billion to fund programs falling under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees and subject to authorization by the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) and defense-related atomic energy programs of the Department of Energy. In addition to authorizing appropriations, the NDAA establishes defense policies and restrictions, and addresses organizational administrative matters related to DOD. Unlike an appropriations bill, the NDAA does not provide budget authority for government activities.
The President’s FY2019 budget request for DOD reflected in part the department’s efforts to align its priorities with the 2018 National Defense Strategy and conform to discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-23).
Of the $708.1 billion, the Trump Administration’s request included $639.1 billion in discretionary funding for the so-called base budget—that is, funds intended to pay for defense-related activities that DOD and other agencies would pursue even if U.S. armed forces were not engaged in contingency operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. The remaining $69 billion of the request, designated as funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), would fund the incremental costs of those ongoing contingency operations, as well as any other costs that Congress and the President agreed to so designate. 
The request was consistent with discretionary spending limits (or caps) on defense activities originally established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123). The FY2019 defense spending cap is $647 billion and applies to discretionary defense programs (excluding OCO). The cap includes programs outside the scope of the NDAA and for which the Administration requested approximately $8 billion. Thus, the portion of the cap applicable to spending authorized by the NDAA is approximately $639 billion.
On May 24, 2018, the House voted 351-66 to pass H.R. 5515, an amended version of the FY2019 NDAA reported by the House Armed Services Committee. On June 18, 2018, the Senate voted 85-10 to pass its version of H.R. 5515, after replacing the House-passed text of H.R. 5515 with an amended version of the FY2019 proposal reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee (S. 2987). On July 25, 2018, a conference committee reported a revised version of the bill (H.Rept. 115-874). On July 26, 2018, the House voted 359-54 to approve the conference report. On August 1, the Senate voted 87-10 to approve the conference report. The conference version authorized approximately the same amount as the President’s request, though with several billions of dollars of adjustments to amounts within the appropriation titles. On August 13, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed the bill into law (P.L. 115-232).

Parfomak",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R44140/R44140.6.pdf,"Executive permission in the form of a Presidential Permit has long been required for the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of certain facilities that cross the United States borders with Canada and Mexico. The constitutional basis for the President’s cross-border permitting authority has been addressed by the courts, but questions remain about the manner in which this authority is exercised among the agencies to which it has been delegated. In particular, some Members of Congress and affected stakeholders seek greater clarity about how Presidential Permit applications are reviewed for various kinds of cross-border energy projects. 
Agency Authorities and Decisionmaking
Congress has shown particular interest in the Presidential Permit review processes for cross-border energy infrastructure as implemented by
The Department of State for pipelines that transport petroleum, petroleum products, and other hazardous liquids;
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for natural gas pipelines; and
The Department of Energy (DOE) for electricity transmission lines.
The State Department makes its permitting decisions primarily in accordance with directives in Executive Order 11423 (E.O.), as amended by E.O. 13337. FERC and DOE make permitting decisions in accordance with E.O. 10485, as amended by E.O. 12038. Broadly speaking, each executive order requires the respective agency to
gather necessary project-specific information from the applicant;
seek input from specific outside federal agencies; and
decide whether to seek input from additional local, state, tribal, or federal agencies or from members of the public.
Under the applicable executive order, each agency is required to issue a Presidential Permit if, after evaluating all relevant project information, the agency determines that the project would “serve the national interest” (pursuant to E.O. 13337) or be “consistent with the public interest” (pursuant to E.O. 10485). For the most part, agencies gather, evaluate, and consider project-related information within the framework of conducting an environmental review. Such reviews are generally conducted in accordance with each agency’s process for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 
In documenting compliance with NEPA, each agency evaluates the direct and indirect effects, including any cumulative impacts, of issuing the permit. To do so, each agency generally looks at the effect of constructing the entire project, not just the portions that would cross the border (i.e., the action for which the Presidential Permit is required). Historically, evaluating impacts of the entire project would not necessarily involve a complex or particularly time-consuming review. With few exceptions, past applications for Presidential Permits have been for pipelines or transmission lines that extend a relatively short distance into a U.S. border state. Recently, however, several pipeline projects—Enbridge Energy’s Alberta Clipper and TransCanada’s Keystone and Keystone XL pipeline—have involved projects that are hundreds of miles long and cross multiple states. It was the larger scope of such projects that, in part, resulted in increased national attention to the most recent proposal, the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2015, the State Department under President Obama denied TransCanada’s application for a Presidential Permit for the project, finding that it did not serve the national interest. However, a new permit application was approved on March 23, 2017, when the State Department, under the Trump Administration, found that the project did serve the national interest.
Issues for Congress
From 2011 through 2015, as the State Department considered permit applications for the Keystone XL pipeline project, Congress proposed a number of bills intended to affect the State Department’s decisionmaking process. Although a permit has been issued for that project, Congress may again consider legislative options to expedite agency decisions on future permit applications. Congress may choose to address issues that arose during the Keystone XL permitting process. For example, during the review, some stakeholders questioned the scope of the NEPA review—some were concerned that it was too broad, others that it was too narrow. Some also argued there was uncertainty over criteria the State Department used to determine whether the project would serve the national interest. Congress could potentially clarify these issues through legislation aimed at defining federal agency roles in authorizing cross-border projects.","International Energy Issues, Environmental Review & Policy, Electricity, Latin America, Caribbean & Canada",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R44140

Turkey and other “midsize powers” such as Saudi Arabia and India seek advantages in a global system with intensifying great-power competition. Some ongoing U.S.-Turkey disagreements stem from differences in the countries’ respective policies in Syria, and from Turkey’s 2019 procurement of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air defense system. Nevertheless, U.S. and Turkish officials emphasize the importance of the bilateral relationship on several foreign policy issues, and the significance of Turkey’s membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Turkey’s proximity to conflicts in the Middle East and Eurasia has made the continuing availability of its territory valuable for its allies. Turkish officials have expressed interest in joining the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, the People’s Republic of China [PRC], South Africa) group and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)—both of which arguably position themselves as alternatives to Western-dominated organizations like the G7 and NATO. Questions persist about whether and when Turkey might join BRICS and/or SCO, and if doing so would be a signal of greater alignment with Russia and the PRC, or of increased Turkish strategic autonomy and regional prominence. 
Congressional and executive branch action regarding Turkey and its neighboring countries could have implications for bilateral ties and U.S. political-military options in the region. Congressional initiatives in the past decade have included conditions on some U.S. arms sales to Turkey, as well as support for certain sanctions against Turkey.
The question of U.S. sales of fighter aircraft and other arms to Turkey has been particularly prominent since Turkey’s 2019 S-400 acquisition and consequent removal from the F-35 program. After Turkey’s parliament approved NATO accession for Sweden in January 2024, the Biden Administration formally notified Congress of a possible $23 billion Foreign Military Sale of 40 new F-16 aircraft, 79 modernization packages for existing F-16s, and associated munitions—apparently, a major step forward for U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation. Turkey’s strategic significance for NATO amid an evolving European security crisis after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine may have contributed to the Administration decision to advance the F-16 transaction. U.S. officials also have suggested that sanctions imposed on Turkey in 2020 for the S-400 acquisition could go away and the F-35 “conversation” can resume if U.S. and Turkish officials properly address the S-400 issue. While Turkish officials have reportedly placed the S-400 in a storage facility rather than activating it and risking additional U.S. retaliatory measures, they also have expressed unwillingness to give it up.
Turkish policies on some other key foreign policy issues have relevance for U.S.-Turkey relations:
Russia and Ukraine. While Turkey’s economic and energy ties with Russia remain a cause for U.S. concern, its support for Ukraine’s defense after Russia’s 2022 invasion, limitation of Russian naval access to and from the Black Sea, and emergence as a mediator during the war has arguably increased Turkey’s importance for U.S. policy. 
Israel and the Palestinians. Since Hamas led attacks into Israel on October 7, 2023, and war ensued, Turkey-Israel diplomatic and economic ties have come under strain. Turkey placed some restrictions on exports to Israel in April 2024, and announced an end to all trade with Israel in May. Additionally, Turkey has continued to provide political support to Hamas, and U.S. officials have imposed sanctions on some alleged Hamas operatives or funding sources in Turkey. 
Syria. Sources of concern for Turkey include nearly four million Syrian refugees in Turkey, and U.S. efforts to counter the Islamic State by working with Syrian Kurds linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (Kurdish acronym PKK, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization). Turkey and allied Syrian armed opposition groups have occupied various areas of northern Syria since 2016, and Turkey’s military continues to target Kurdish fighters in Syria and Iraq—apparently also damaging some civilian infrastructure in Syria.
Domestically, some observers voice concerns about the largely authoritarian rule of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has led Turkey since 2003 and consolidated his control over time—including after a failed 2016 coup attempt. Despite a serious electoral challenge in May 2023 during an economic crisis, Erdogan and his party retained power, though the government faces allegations of human rights and rule of law violations. With inflation near 70% despite measures over the past year to counter it, Erdogan’s party lost in March 2024 local elections. Analysts speculate about Erdogan’s potential interest in and prospects for another presidential term in the next national elections, scheduled for 2028.","Europe, Russia & Eurasia, Middle East & North Africa",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R44000

The reliance on foreign workers is not simple to measure. In the 118th Congress, the House Committee on Agriculture formed a bipartisan Agricultural Labor Working Group “to focus on the workforce issues faced by the nation’s agricultural producers.” Much of this committee’s work focused on the growing role of the H-2A agricultural worker visa program, amidst uncertainty over the share of agricultural employment now provided by H-2A workers. As an example of this uncertainty, the Secure the Border Act of 2023 (H.R. 2), which passed the House in the 118th Congress, would have required the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to submit a report on agricultural labor, including the number of people in the agricultural workforce and the number of foreign nationals in the agricultural workforce who are authorized for this work. 
This report describes how agricultural employment is measured in the United States through official government data sources. Agricultural employment is measured in different ways in different sources, which provide information about different portions of the agricultural workforce. Some federal data sources generally used to measure employment in the United States include agricultural workers, some do not include them at all, and others include only a subset of agricultural workers. Some data sources that focus on agricultural employment include workers on H-2A visas and others do not. This report describes the agricultural and H-2A coverage of federal employment data sources.
Most agricultural workers are hired for a wage or salary. Data on employment of hired workers in agricultural industries are available from several sources. Notably, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) measures employment of workers covered by Unemployment Insurance (UI). Coverage requirements of UI vary somewhat from state to state, but agricultural employment on all but the farms with the fewest employees is generally included, while workers on H-2A visas in many states are excluded. QCEW data show employment in crop production and in support activities for agriculture are highly seasonal. They also show an overall shift in employment from crop producers to farm labor contractors between 2004 and 2019, driven by employment shifts within California. A separate source of employment data for hired workers is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Labor Survey (FLS), which measures employment of workers on farms and ranches. Unlike the QCEW, the FLS includes workers on H-2A visas, but it does not cover employment by farm labor contractors. 
Data on the number of farmers and ranchers are also available from several sources, which measure this group in different ways. As examples, the Current Population Survey (CPS) measures the number of people for whom agricultural work is their main job, while the Census of Agriculture (COA) asks the number of producers (i.e., decisionmakers) on each farm or ranch. 
Foreign born agricultural workers include people with and without legal authorization to work in the United States. The only federal data source that collects information on whether farmworkers have legal authorization to work in the United States is the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), a survey of one or two thousand crop workers per year. These data show a sharp increase in the percentage of crop workers without legal authorization to work in the United States between 1990 and 2000, and a decline in the percentage of crop workers without legal authorization in more recent years.
Data on the number of agricultural workers in the United States on H-2A visas, where they work, and where they come from are collected by several federal agencies, none of which collect all of these data. The Department of Labor collects and publishes detailed agricultural industry information from employers seeking labor certification to hire workers on these visas, but not all labor certifications result in hires. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services collects and publishes information on the geography of employers petitioning for visas to hire these workers, but not all approved visa petitions result in hiring the full number of approved workers. The Department of State collects information on the number of workers who actually obtain these visas and their countries of origin. However, it is not possible to estimate the number of H-2A workers working in a specific industry and/or geographic area without making various assumptions. 
Two summary tables (Table 3 and Table 4) comparing the coverage of agricultural employment in these data sources are provided at the end of this report.

Carey,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46190/R46190.2.pdf,"The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), enacted in 1946, is known primarily for its procedural requirements for notice-and-comment rulemaking. Those requirements state that when issuing regulations, agencies must generally give public notice (i.e., issue a proposed rule), hold a public comment period, and publish a final rule.
A lesser known provision in the APA is a petition mechanism through which any interested party can request an agency to issue, amend, or repeal a rule (Section 553(e)). Such petitions are sometimes referred to as 553(e) petitions, petitions for rulemaking, petitions for reconsideration, administrative petitions, or citizens’ petitions. The APA petition mechanism is a potentially efficient (and arguably underused) means for an individual or stakeholder to call on an agency to take a particular action.
“Each agency shall give an interested person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule” (5 U.S.C. §553(e)).

Although Section 553(e) is only one sentence in length and provides very little detail, other sections of the APA contain some additional requirements for agencies with regard to receiving, considering, and responding to rulemaking petitions. An agency is not necessarily required to grant the petition or take the requested action, but the APA does require the agency to consider the petition and respond and to do so “within a reasonable time.” Notably, however, agencies have a great deal of discretion in determining the specifics of their procedures for receiving, considering, and responding to petitions. In 2014, the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) found that “few agencies have in place official procedures for accepting, processing, and responding to petitions for rulemaking” and that “how petitions are received and treated varies across—and even within—agencies.”
The APA’s requirement for a petition mechanism applies to all agencies covered by the APA, which includes executive agencies and independent regulatory agencies. The APA’s definition of rule is broad and covers a variety of agency actions, including several types of actions that are not subject to the APA’s notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Such actions include agency interpretive rules and policy statements—categories that are often colloquially referred to as “guidance documents”—and rules of agency organization, procedure, and practice. Thus, the petition mechanism could potentially be used for more than just rules that have undergone, or would be required to undergo, the APA’s notice-and-comment procedures.
If an agency grants a petition for rulemaking—thus issuing, amending, or repealing a rule per request of the petitioner—any relevant procedural requirements for rulemaking or other type of action would still apply. Furthermore, in taking any action pursuant to a petition, the agency may act only within the delegated authority Congress has provided to it in statute.
This report briefly discusses the origin of the APA petition mechanism, outlines the mechanism’s requirements for agencies, provides information from various outside sources about what may make an effective petition, discusses potential benefits to agencies and the public, and, finally, identifies some examples of statutory petition mechanisms that Congress created in addition to the APA’s.

Although some believe these tools do little to restrain the behavior of U.S. adversaries, while doing too much to restrain U.S. military forces and operations, many others see them as an effective means to promote transparency, ease military planning, limit forces, and protect against uncertainty and surprise. Arms control and nonproliferation efforts have produced formal treaties and agreements, informal arrangements, and cooperative threat reduction and monitoring mechanisms. 
The United States and the Soviet Union began to sign agreements limiting their strategic offensive nuclear weapons in the early 1970s. Progress in negotiating and implementing these agreements was often slow, and subject to the tenor of the broader U.S.-Soviet relationship. As the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s, the pace of negotiations quickened, with the two sides signing treaties limiting intermediate-range and long-range weapons. Since then, a series of progressive U.S.-Russian agreements reduced both sides’ nuclear stockpiles and delivery vehicles. U.S.-Russian arms control cooperation has sharply deteriorated in recent years, as has Russian compliance with long-standing arms control commitments. Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the further deterioration in U.S.-Russia relations in 2022, the prospect for new arms control negotiations and bilateral strategic risk reduction measures is uncertain, at least in the short- to medium-term. Nevertheless, the United States has sought to engage in bilateral and multilateral diplomatic efforts to reduce the risk of conflict involving the employment of nuclear weapons. 
The United States is a prominent actor in an international regime that attempts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to new countries, or nuclear “nonproliferation.” This regime includes formal treaties, international organizations that monitor compliance, and export control arrangements. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) serves as the cornerstone of this regime, with all but four states participating in it. The International Atomic Energy Agency monitors nuclear energy programs to make sure they remain peaceful, and helps countries develop and access the benefits of nuclear science. Other measures, such as sanctions, interdiction efforts, and informal cooperative endeavors, also seek to slow or stop the spread of nuclear materials and the means to produce nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as their means of delivery.
The international community has adopted a number of agreements that address nonnuclear weapons. The Chemical Weapons and Biological Weapons Conventions prohibit both types of weapons. Other arrangements seek to slow the spread of technologies that countries could use to develop advanced conventional weapons. The United States and international partners have also worked to prevent terrorist access or use of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, known collectively as weapons of mass destruction (WMD).","Strategic Forces, CBRN, Arms Control & Nonproliferation",www.congress.gov/crs-report/RL33865

Fischer, Patricia Moloney Figliola",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R42604/R42604.9.pdf,"The Department of Defense (DOD) is the single largest energy consumer in the nation. As the largest owner of federal data centers, with 772, the DOD has more than twice as many centers as any other agency. By consolidating some of its data centers, DOD could have a significant positive impact on energy savings for the federal government. DOD has instituted a number of policy directives, as have all federal agencies, that influence energy use in its data centers.
Data centers are facilities—buildings or parts of buildings—used to store, manage, and disseminate electronic information for a computer network. They house servers, which are computers used to perform network-management functions such as data storage and processing, and communications equipment and devices to connect the servers with the network. Data centers usually draw their power from the electric grid, but they may also contain specialized power conversion and backup equipment to maintain reliable power. Power consumption varies greatly among data centers but is typically many times higher than for other kinds of buildings. 
Within the context of the FDCCI, DOD’s efforts are intended to address concerns about rising energy demands and costs of data centers, associated increases in carbon emissions, expanding real-estate footprints of data centers, and rising real-estate costs. According to DOD, the Department plans to reduce the number of its data centers by about 30% by 2013, and the number of servers by 25%. DOD intends to use savings generated from consolidation to pay the consolidation costs. DOD also plans to use cloud computing as part of its savings effort. 
As with any endeavor being implemented across so many departments and agencies, proper management of the initiative will be crucial to its success and, in turn, to achieving the projected savings. Unlike many programs that are overseen by a single committee, implementation of the FDCCI may require oversight by any committee with legislative jurisdiction over a department or agency. Understanding the management challenges and policy considerations involved with data center consolidation (e.g., balancing up-front costs with ongoing savings, maintaining data security, and maximizing energy savings through facilities design) as well as being aware of the issues specific to implementing the FDCCI are important steps to achieving effective congressional oversight of the FDCCI. In conducting oversight, Congress may wish to
conduct hearings to monitor the activities of OMB as it manages the FDCCI or the progress of individual departments and agencies as they implement the FDCCI;
review FDCCI plans and status reports created internally by the individual department or agency, or externally by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the committee of jurisdiction.
Finally, Congress may wish to examine the current “reach” of the FDCCI and consider whether expanding the initiative to include other agencies, as GAO has recommended, is appropriate.",,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R42604

One of the classes of prohibited persons are those who have been “adjudicated as a mental defective” or committed to a mental institution. Under the provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) administers the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) that allows federally-licensed firearms dealers to perform a required background check on potential buyers to ensure they are not prohibited from purchasing firearms and ammunition. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has the authority to determine if a VA program beneficiary is incompetent based on the beneficiary’s inability to manage his or her own affairs. Beneficiaries who are determined to be incompetent have their benefits paid on their behalf to a third-party fiduciary. It is the policy of the VA to refer the names of all beneficiaries determined to be incompetent to NICS under the category of “adjudicated as a mental defective.” The VA is responsible for approximately 98% of the NICS referrals based on mental health conditions made by federal agencies. Under the provisions of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 and the 21st Century Cures Act, VA beneficiaries have certain rights to challenge the VA’s determination of incompetency and referral to NICS before and after the agency has taken action. 
Since the 110th Congress, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act has been introduced in each Congress. This legislation would prohibit the VA from referring a beneficiary to NICS solely on the determination that the beneficiary must have a fiduciary to manage his or her benefits, unless there is a finding from a judicial authority that the beneficiary is a threat to self or others. In the 118th Congress, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Mike Bost (H.R. 705) and in the Senate by Senator John Kennedy (S. 1875).","Civil Rights & Liberties, Veterans Disability Compensation & Pensions, Department of Veterans Affairs Administration, Firearms & Regulation",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R47626

Murrill,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R44630/R44630.2.pdf,"The United States is party to 14 international free trade agreements (FTAs) with 20 countries. These agreements impose a wide variety of international obligations on the United States and its trading partners. Such obligations address import tariffs, as well as potential nontariff trade barriers. A country that is party to an FTA and that maintains laws, regulations, or practices that violate one of these obligations may be subject to trade retaliation (e.g., other FTA parties may increase tariffs on the country’s exports) or may have to pay a fine or monetary compensation to an FTA partner or injured investor. During the past decade, some have suggested that the United States should attempt to renegotiate—and possibly withdraw from—the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Such statements have prompted congressional interest in domestic and international legal issues pertaining to U.S. termination of, or withdrawal from, an FTA.
U.S. FTAs have historically been approved as congressional-executive agreements by a majority vote of each house of Congress rather than as treaties ratified by the President after Senate approval by a two-thirds majority vote. FTAs are not self-executing agreements. Thus, legislation is required to provide U.S. bodies with domestic legal authority necessary to enforce and comply with the agreements’ provisions. FTAs are legally binding agreements under international law.
All U.S. FTAs that have entered into force as of the date of this report contain provisions allowing for a party’s withdrawal from, or termination of, the FTA upon advance notice to the other parties. Questions have arisen regarding whether the President can unilaterally withdraw the United States from such agreements without the consent of Congress. The Constitution does not specifically address withdrawal from treaties or congressional-executive agreements. In some cases, the United States has withdrawn from international legal agreements pursuant to the joint action of the political branches. However, the weight of judicial and scholarly opinion suggests that the President possesses the exclusive constitutional authority to communicate with foreign powers, and such authority might provide the President with a constitutional basis for withdrawing from at least some types of international agreements. The agreement’s subject matter, however, might be relevant to a legal analysis. As a practical matter, the President’s communication of a notice of withdrawal from an FTA to trade partners in accordance with the FTA’s terms would likely release the United States from its international obligations from the effective date of withdrawal onward as provided in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which the United States has not ratified but considers to reflect, in many aspects, customary international law. Congress may thus find it difficult to prevent the President from terminating or withdrawing from an FTA. On the other hand, if Congress wanted to pressure the President to withdraw, it could enact a statute (over any presidential veto) that would repeal its approval and implementation in domestic law of an FTA.
Even in the event that the President could properly withdraw from an FTA unilaterally, the President cannot make laws, and thus repeal of federal statutory provisions implementing U.S. FTA obligations requires congressional action. Congress has enacted provisions that appear to delegate to the President authority to repeal some provisions of federal statutory law implementing FTA obligations upon termination of, or U.S. withdrawal from, the agreement. However, the President might not be able to exercise this authority if a court struck down such provisions as unconstitutional or Congress amended or repealed them. Although the President cannot repeal other statutory provisions implementing FTA obligations without further congressional action, if the President identified a federal regulation, order, or practice that implemented FTA obligations, the President may be able to rely on constitutional or statutory authority to repeal or limit the effect of the measure. Such actions by the President may be subject to judicial review.",Trade Agreements,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R44630

Theohary,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R45142/R45142.5.pdf,"Information warfare is hardly a new endeavor. In the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, Persian ruler Xerxes used intimidation tactics to break the will of Greek city-states. Alexander the Great used cultural assimilation to subdue dissent and maintain conquered lands. Military scholars trace the modern use of information as a tool in guerilla warfare to fifth-century BC Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu’s book The Art of War and its emphasis on accurate intelligence for decision superiority over a mightier foe. These ancient strategists helped to lay the foundation for information warfare strategy in modern times. 
Taking place below the level of armed conflict, information warfare (IW) is the range of military and government operations to protect and exploit the information environment. Although information is recognized as an element of national power, IW is a relatively poorly understood concept in the United States, with several other terms being used to describe the same or similar sets of activity. IW is a strategy for using information to pursue a competitive advantage, including offensive and defensive efforts. A form of political warfare, IW is a means through which nations achieve strategic objectives and advance foreign policy goals. Defensive efforts include information assurance/information security, while offensive efforts include information operations. Similar terms sometimes used to characterize information warfare include active measures, hybrid warfare, and gray zone warfare. 
IW is sometimes referred to as a “disinformation campaign,” yet disinformation is only one of the tactics used in information operations (IO). The types of information used in IO include propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation. 
As cyberspace presents an easy, cost-effective method to communicate a message to large swaths of populations, much of present day information warfare takes place on the internet, leading some to conflate “cyberwarfare” with information warfare. While IO in the United States tends to be seen as a purely military activity, other countries and terrorist organizations have robust information warfare strategies and use a whole-of-government or whole-of-society approach to information operations. 
In terms of U.S. government bureaucracy, there are debates in the United States about where the IW center of gravity should be. During the Cold War, the epicenter in the U.S. government was the Department of State and the U.S. Information Agency. Since 9/11, much of the current doctrine and capability resides with the military, leading some to posit that the epicenter should be the Pentagon. But others worry that the military should not be involved in the production of propaganda.
This report offers Congress a conceptual framework for understanding IW as a strategy, discusses past and present IW-related organizations within the U.S. government, and uses several case studies as examples of IW strategy in practice. Countries discussed include Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.

Carey,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R44348/R44348.2.pdf,"Federal agencies issue thousands of regulations each year under delegated authority from Congress. Over the past 70 years, Congress and various Presidents have created a set of procedures agencies must follow to issue these regulations, some of which contain requirements for the calculation and consideration of costs, benefits, and other economic effects of regulations. In recent years, many Members of Congress have expressed an interest in various regulatory reform efforts that would change the current set of rulemaking requirements, including requirements to estimate costs and benefits of regulations. As part of this debate, it has become common for supporters of regulatory reform to comment on the total cost of federal regulation.
Estimating the total cost of regulations is inherently difficult. Current estimates of the cost of regulation should be viewed with a great deal of caution. 
Scholars and governmental entities estimating the total cost of regulation use one of two methods, which are referred to as the “bottom-up” and the “top-down” approach. The bottom-up approach aggregates individual cost and benefit estimates produced by agencies, arriving at a government-wide total. In 2014, the annual report to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget estimated the total cost of federal regulations to range between $68.5 and $101.8 billion and the total benefits to be between $261.7 billion and $1,042.1 billion. The top-down approach estimates the total cost of regulation by looking at the relationship of certain macroeconomic factors, including the size of a country’s economy and a proxy measure of how much regulation the country has. This method estimates the economic effect that a hypothetical change in the amount of regulation in the United States might have, considering that economic effect to represent the cost of regulation. One frequently cited study estimated the total cost of regulation in 2014 to be $2.028 trillion, $1.439 trillion of which was calculated using this top-down approach.
Each approach has inherent advantages and disadvantages. The bottom-up approach relies on agency estimates of the effects of specific regulations and can also be used to estimate benefits, because agencies typically estimate both costs and benefits under current requirements so that they may be compared and evaluated against alternatives. The bottom-up approach does not, however, include estimates of costs and benefits of all rules, nor does it include costs and benefits of regulations that are not monetized—meaning that the bottom-up approach is likely an underestimate of the total cost of regulation. Furthermore, the individual estimates produced by agencies and used in the bottom-up approach may not always be accurate. 
The top-down approach can be used to estimate effects of rules that are not captured by the bottom-up approach—such as indirect costs and costs of rules issued by independent regulatory agencies, which are not included in the bottom-up approach—thus theoretically capturing the whole universe of regulatory costs. Its results are, however, entirely reliant upon a number of methodological challenges that are difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. The biggest challenge may be finding a valid proxy measure for regulation: proxy measures of the total amount of regulation in a country are inherently imprecise and cannot be reliably used to estimate macroeconomic outcomes. Because of this difficulty in identifying a suitable proxy measure of regulation, even if the total cost of regulation is substantial, it cannot be estimated with any precision. The top-down method is intended to measure only costs; measuring costs without also considering benefits does not provide the complete context for evaluating the appropriateness of a country’s amount of regulation.
For these and other reasons, both approaches to estimating the total cost of regulation have inherent—and potentially insurmountable—flaws. The discrepancy between the two approaches and their associated estimates raises the question of the utility of using such figures in the regulatory reform debate.

Rosso, Sarah A. Donovan",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47219/R47219.2.pdf,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related recession led to massive job loss in early 2020, with some lasting labor market effects. Because a majority of Americans receive their health insurance through an employment setting (either directly through their own employer or through a spouse’s or parent’s employer), these large and persistent job losses raise questions about the extent to which similar declines in employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) coverage occurred. 
CRS analysis shows that between March 2019 and March 2021, employment levels fell from 85.0% of the working-age population (persons aged 19 to 64) to 82.9% of the working-age population, a decrease of almost 6.0 million jobs. Over this period, the percentage of all working-age adults enrolled in ESI dropped from 62.2% to 61.6% (a decrease of approximately 1.2 million adults with ESI coverage), which is a smaller decline than some studies published early in the pandemic predicted.
The extent to which job losses contribute to a decline in ESI coverage depends on various factors. These factors include, among others, whether the lost jobs offered ESI, whether individuals who lost their jobs were enrolled in ESI, and whether formerly covered individuals who lost their jobs were able to enroll in ESI coverage through a spouse’s or parent’s employer.
The small percentage-point decline in ESI coverage among the working-age population (relative to employment loss) between March 2019 and March 2021 can be partially explained by the fact that job loss over that period was, in the aggregate, concentrated in jobs that were less likely to include an offer of health insurance coverage. The number of workers reporting their employer did not offer health insurance fell by 3.4 million, a 10.1% loss, which exceeds the decline in the number of workers reporting their employer did offer ESI (2.6 million, a 2.7% loss) between March 2019 and March 2021.
Although COVID-19-related layoffs were widespread, some worker groups were more affected than others. As such, this report evaluates employment loss and its composition (i.e., the extent to which lost jobs had offered ESI), as well as the relationship between job loss and ESI offer rates and coverage across industries and selected demographic groups. 
Top-level findings from analyses by industry and demographics include the following:
The four industries with the lowest ESI offer rates in 2019 (all of which were below the overall ESI rate) account for nearly half of the decrease in employment between March 2019 and March 2021. 
Job loss was not exclusive to those without ESI offers: overall and within industries, employment declined to varying degrees among both jobs that offered ESI and those that did not. 
Across the different demographic groups, ESI coverage rates generally rose or remained stable among workers and declined or remained stable among the broader working-age adult population. 
Working-age adults with lower levels of educational attainment were particularly vulnerable to loss of ESI coverage during the analysis period.","Private Health Insurance, Wages & Benefits, Labor Force",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R47219

Congress subsequently enacted new nuclear plant security requirements and has repeatedly focused attention on regulation and enforcement by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). More than a decade after the 9/11 attacks, security at nuclear plants remains an important concern.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05, P.L. 109-58) imposed specific criteria for NRC to consider in revising the “Design Basis Threat” (DBT), which specifies the maximum severity of potential attacks that a nuclear plant’s security force must be capable of repelling. In response to the legislative mandate, NRC revised the DBT (10 C.F.R. Part 73.1) on April 18, 2007. Among other changes, the revisions expanded the assumed capabilities of adversaries to operate as one or more teams and attack from multiple entry points.
To strengthen nuclear plant security inspections, EPACT05 required NRC to conduct “force-on-force” security exercises at nuclear power plants at least once every three years. In these exercises, a mock adversary force from outside a nuclear plant attempts to penetrate the plant’s vital area and simulate damage to a “target set” of key safety components. During calendar year 2012, NRC conducted 23 force-on-force (FOF) inspections at 22 commercial nuclear plants and one fuel cycle facility. Eleven of those inspections found performance deficiencies: 19 with low significance (green findings), one “greater than green” finding, and three severity level IV (least serious) violations. One exercise resulted in the simulated destruction of or damage to a complete “target set” of vital plant components that were under mock attack. When force-on-force exercises indicate inadequate protection against the DBT, additional security measures must be promptly implemented, according to NRC.
Nuclear power plant vulnerability to deliberate aircraft crashes has been a continuing issue. After much consideration, NRC published final rules on June 12, 2009, to require all new nuclear power plants to incorporate design features that would ensure that, in the event of a crash by a large commercial aircraft, the reactor core would remain cooled or the reactor containment would remain intact, and radioactive releases would not occur from spent fuel storage pools.
NRC rejected proposals that existing reactors also be required to protect against aircraft crashes, such as by adding large external steel barriers, deciding that other mitigation measures already required by NRC for all reactors were sufficient. In 2002, NRC ordered all nuclear power plants to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of large fires and explosions that could result from aircraft crashes or other causes. NRC published a broad final rule on nuclear reactor security March 27, 2009, including fire mitigation strategies and requirements that reactors establish procedures for responding to specific aircraft threats.
Other ongoing nuclear plant security issues include the vulnerability of spent fuel pools, which hold highly radioactive nuclear fuel after its removal from the reactor, standards for nuclear plant security personnel, and nuclear plant emergency planning. NRC’s March 2009 security regulations addressed some of those concerns and included a number of other security enhancements.",,www.congress.gov/crs-report/RL34331

In other words, the IoT potentially includes huge numbers and kinds of interconnected objects. It is often considered the next major stage in the evolution of cyberspace. Some observers believe it might even lead to a world where cyberspace and human space would seem to effectively merge, with unpredictable but potentially momentous societal and cultural impacts.
Two features make objects part of the IoT—a unique identifier and Internet connectivity. Such “smart” objects each have a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address to identify the object sending and receiving information. Smart objects can form systems that communicate among themselves, usually in concert with computers, allowing automated and remote control of many independent processes and potentially transforming them into integrated systems.
Those systems can potentially impact homes and communities, factories and cities, and every sector of the economy, both domestically and globally. Although the full extent and nature of the IoT’s impacts remain uncertain, economic analyses predict that it will contribute trillions of dollars to economic growth over the next decade. Sectors that may be particularly affected include agriculture, energy, government, health care, manufacturing, and transportation. 
The IoT can contribute to more integrated and functional infrastructure, especially in “smart cities,” with projected improvements in transportation, utilities, and other municipal services. The Obama Administration announced a smart-cities initiative in September 2015. 
There is no single federal agency that has overall responsibility for the IoT. Agencies may find IoT applications useful in helping them fulfill their missions. Each is responsible for the functioning and security of its own IoT, although some technologies, such as drones, may fall under the jurisdiction of other agencies as well. Various agencies also have relevant regulatory, sector-specific, and other mission-related responsibilities, such as the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and Transportation, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission. 
Security and privacy are often cited as major issues for the IoT, given the perceived difficulties of providing adequate cybersecurity for it, the increasing role of smart objects in controlling components of infrastructure, and the enormous increase in potential points of attack posed by the proliferation of such objects. The IoT may also pose increased risks to privacy, with cyberattacks potentially resulting in exfiltration of identifying or other sensitive information about an individual. With an increasing number of IoT objects in use, privacy concerns also include questions about the ownership, processing, and use of the data they generate.
Several other issues might affect the continued development and implementation of the IoT. Among them are
the lack of consensus standards for the IoT, especially with respect to connectivity;
the transition to a new Internet Protocol (IPv6) that can handle the exponential increase in the number of IP addresses that the IoT will require;
methods for updating the software used by IoT objects in response to security and other needs; 
energy management for IoT objects, especially those not connected to the electric grid; and
the role of the federal government, including investment, regulation of applications, access to wireless communications, and the impact of federal rules regarding “net neutrality.”
No bills specifically on the IoT have been introduced in the 114th Congress, although S.Res. 110 was agreed to in March 2015, and H.Res. 195 was introduced in April. Both call for a U.S. IoT strategy, a focus on a consensus-based approach to IoT development, commitment to federal use of the IoT, and its application in addressing challenging societal issues. House and Senate hearings have been held on the IoT, and several congressional caucuses may consider associated issues. Moreover, bills affecting privacy, cybersecurity, and other aspects of communication could affect IoT applications.",,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R44227

Federal efforts to improve first responder mental health involve multiple programs spread out across several executive departments and agencies. For example, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operate mental health programming for first responders. Some programs focus on mental health for occupations generally, while others target specific occupations or address specific circumstances such as post-disaster response.
Most programs are the efforts of a sole executive department with jurisdiction over the type of first responder. For example, DOJ administers grant programs specifically for law enforcement. Programs under the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA, P.L. 115-113) specifically focus on the mental health of law enforcement officers. Other programs operated by DOJ can provide assistance for law enforcement officer mental health, but do not focus solely on this issue. DHS, on the other hand, focuses their efforts on firefighters and emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. For example, the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), which is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within DHS, provides resources encouraging fire departments to work in partnership with mental health organizations. HHS supports the provision of mental health prevention and treatment services, the collection of public health data, and public health campaigns promoting mental health generally; some initiatives include programs specifically for certain occupations or industries.
Federal first responder mental health programs are generally conducted within executive departments with jurisdiction over the type of first responder, with few interagency initiatives and little overall coordination. In one joint initiative, the Office of EMS in the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) EMS provides support to the Federal Interagency Committee on EMS (FICEMS), a coordinating body focused on defining federal research priorities and programs to support the EMS community. FICEMS member agencies include the Department of Defense (DOD), DHS, Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and HHS. While FICEMS represents an example of interagency coordination, most federal activities involving first responders are single programs for individual occupations administered by a single department.
Congress may build on existing efforts, address current gaps, or improve established programs related to first responder mental health. For example, Congress could attempt to increase access to services for first responders. This could include promoting mental health training or programming tailored to these occupations. Congress may also consider addressing barriers to first responder utilization of mental health care, which include lack of knowledge about services, lack of systemic support for mental wellness within first responder organizations, and stigma. Additionally, in considering support for first responder mental health, Congress may determine how to organize and execute these programs on a federal level. A coordinated approach may include a central clearinghouse for first responder mental health services, administration and funding from a single agency, or more comprehensive mental health prevention and treatment services that address gaps in care. Another consideration for Congress involves the degree of empirical support for first responder mental health programs, since not all post-crisis or trauma-based interventions have been found to be safe and effective. 
This report provides information and resources regarding federal programs targeting the mental health of first responders. Here, federal activities are displayed by the type of first responder (i.e., police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel) and the primary corresponding executive department of jurisdiction. Other selected resources—including some non-federal efforts—are also listed. An additional section describes related federal programs seeking to address mental health and suicide administered by HHS, which may not specifically target first responders but could still serve this population.",Public Health Services & Special Populations,www.congress.gov/crs-report/R46555
Reports,R43237,2023-03-23 04:00:00+00:00,Active,Programs for Minority-Serving Institutions Under the Higher Education Act,2025-04-18T21:23:08Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R43237,124,Cassandria Dortch,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R43237/R43237.19.pdf,"Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) are institutions of higher education that serve high concentrations of minority students who, historically, have been underrepresented in higher education. Many MSIs have faced challenges in securing adequate financial support, thus affecting their ability to develop and enhance their academic offerings and ultimately serve their students. Federal higher education policy recognizes the importance of such institutions and targets financial resources to them. Funding for MSIs is channeled through numerous federal agencies, and several of these funding sources are available to MSIs through grant programs authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA; P.L. 89-329). Over the years, HEA programs that support MSIs have expanded and now include programs for institutions serving a wide variety of student populations. In FY2023, MSI programs under the HEA were appropriated approximately $1.29 billion through annual discretionary and mandatory appropriations. 
Currently, the HEA authorizes several programs that benefit MSIs:
Title III-A authorizes the Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP), which provides grants to institutions with financial limitations and a high percentage of needy students. Title III-A also authorizes separate similar programs for American Indian tribally controlled colleges and universities; Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions; predominantly Black institutions (PBIs); Native American-serving, nontribal institutions; and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions. Grants awarded under these programs assist eligible institutions in strengthening their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities. The SIP is funded through annual discretionary appropriations; the remaining Title III-A programs are funded through annual discretionary (as specified in Title III-G) and mandatory appropriations (as specified in Title III-F). 
Title III-B authorizes the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) program and the Historically Black Graduate Institutions (HBGIs) program, both of which award grants to eligible institutions to assist them in strengthening their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities. The HBCUs program is funded through annual discretionary (as specified in Title III-G) and mandatory appropriations (as specified in Title III-F); the HBGIs program is funded through annual discretionary appropriations (as specified in Title III-G). 
Title III-C authorizes the Endowment Challenge Grant program, which has not been funded since FY1995.
Title III-D authorizes the HBCU Capital Financing Program, which assists HBCUs in obtaining low-cost capital financing for campus maintenance and construction projects and is generally funded through annual discretionary appropriations.
Title III-E authorizes the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program, which provides grants to MSIs and other entities to effect long-term improvements in science and engineering education and is funded through annual discretionary appropriations.
Title III-F provides annual mandatory appropriations for many of the Title III-A and Title III-B MSI programs. It also establishes and provides mandatory appropriations for the Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Articulation Program, which provides grants to HSIs to increase the number of Hispanic students in STEM fields and to develop model transfer and articulation agreements.
Title V authorizes the HSI program and the Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans (PPOHA), both of which award grants to eligible institutions to assist them in strengthening their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities. Typically, both programs are funded through annual discretionary appropriations, but additional annual mandatory appropriations were provided for the PPOHA program from FY2009 through FY2014.
Title VII-A-4 authorizes Masters Degree Programs at HBCUs and PBIs, which provide grants to select HBCUs and PBIs to improve graduate educational opportunities. Both programs are authorized to receive annual discretionary appropriations, but currently, only Masters Degree Programs at HBCUs receive such funding. Annual mandatory appropriations were provided for both programs from FY2009 through FY2014.","Education & Labor Law, Postsecondary Education",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R43237
Reports,R42504,2018-10-15 04:00:00+00:00,Active,"VA Housing: Guaranteed Loans, Direct Loans, and Specially Adapted Housing Grants",2025-04-18T18:18:44Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/crsreport/R42504,124,Libby Perl,https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R42504/R42504.19.pdf,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has assisted veterans with homeownership since 1944, when Congress enacted the loan guaranty program to help veterans returning from World War II purchase homes. The loan guaranty program assists veterans by insuring mortgages made by private lenders, and is available for the purchase or construction of homes as well as to refinance existing loans. 
The loan guaranty has expanded over the years so that it is available to (1) all veterans who fulfill specific duration of service requirements or who were released from active duty due to service-connected disabilities, (2) members of the reserves who completed at least six years of service, and (3) spouses of veterans who died in action, of service-connected disabilities, or who died while receiving (or were entitled to receive) benefits for certain service-connected disabilities (see Table 1). Under the loan guaranty, the VA agrees to reimburse lenders for a portion of losses if borrowers default. Unlike insurance provided through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance program, the VA does not insure 100% of the loan, and instead the percentage of the loan that is guaranteed is based on the principal balance of the loan (see Table 3). 
Veterans who enter into VA-guaranteed loans must pay an up-front fee based on a number of factors that include the type of loan entered into (for example, purchase or refinance), whether service was active duty or in the reserves, whether the loan is the first or subsequent VA loan a borrower has entered into, and the amount of down payment (see Table 6). Borrowers are not required to make a down payment for a VA-guaranteed loan, but the up-front fee is reduced if there is a down payment of 5% or more. Most borrowers (80% of purchasers in FY2017) do not make a down payment.
In addition to guaranteeing loans from private lenders, the VA also makes direct loans to borrowers in certain circumstances. The original VA direct loan, which was targeted to veterans in rural areas, is now available only to veterans or servicemembers with certain service-connected disabilities. Another direct loan program, originally enacted as a demonstration program in 1992, serves Native American veterans, including veterans living in American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition, the VA may enter into direct loans in cases where a borrower is delinquent or defaults on a VA-guaranteed loan. The VA may either acquire a loan from a lender and continue servicing the loan itself (called acquired loans) or, in cases of foreclosure, the VA may purchase the property and resell it. In these cases, the VA may enter into a loan with a purchaser whether or not he or she is a veteran (called vendee loans).
A third way in which the VA provides housing assistance to both veterans and active duty servicemembers is through the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Program. Through the SAH program, veterans with certain service-connected disabilities may obtain grants from the VA to purchase or remodel homes to fit their needs. The amount of a grant depends on the disability, and in some cases grants can be used to modify the homes of family members with whom veterans or servicemembers are staying (see Table 7).
This report discusses these three types of housing assistance—the loan guaranty program, direct loan programs, and Specially Adapted Housing program—their origins, how they operate, and how they are funded. The report also briefly describes a home rehabilitation pilot program designed to help veterans who have low incomes or disabilities repair or modify their homes, and has a section that discusses the default and foreclosure of VA-guaranteed loans.","Veterans Housing, Veterans Education, Employment & Housing, Homeownership & Housing Finance",www.congress.gov/crs-report/R42504
